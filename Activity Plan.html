						<h2>About</h2>
						
						<p>The Activity Plan is an activity which helps teams plan out their activities, and assign resources and teams to tasks. Team members should outline detailed tasks or activities necessary to achieve higher-level goals. </p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>Use Cases</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Planning out activities for the team for the upcoming months</li>
<li>Setting clear milestones for programme organisers to check-in with participants at.</li>
<li>Clarifying expectations, roles and responsibilities from each party.</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>Limitations</h2>
						
						<p>The Activity Plan is only as effective as the amount of detail it has. The more detailed the responsibilities and checkpoints are, the more likely the team is to use it.</p>

<li>The ‘<span>Timeline</span>’ section can be filled following 3-6-9-12 months or can be rewritten to the timeline of the participant</span>’s choice. These increments should be spaced close or far enough from each other for all parties to feel in touch with the on-going project.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Tasks to be Completed</span>’ section is where the tasks/activities to be completed are listed down. These are the tasks that the team is confident of completing by the time given.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Resources Needed</span>’ section is where the resources needed to fulfill the tasks by the given time are written down. This can be financial, server access or staffing resources.</li>
<li>‘<span>Teams Involved</span>’ are the teams directly responsible for the tasks to be completed. </li>

					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck). </li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Start with participants’ existing knowledge of their activities and tasks to help them create an initial version of the plan.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants walk you through their plan and help them space out activities/timelines as needed.</li>

<li>Are the timelines listed realistic? Do they fit within the time between bootcamps or workshops?</li>
<li>Does the team have the capability to complete the tasks/activities within the given timeframes?</li>
<li>Does the intent of the team match the activities and resources they plan to commit to?</li>
<li>Can the team add more detail or criteria to the map for a more well defined project management plan?</li>
