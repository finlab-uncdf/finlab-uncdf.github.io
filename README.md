# Toolsite
repo for creating a toolkit microsite 

This is a modified version of the Toolsite created for UNCDF. In this version, a digitized form for the Startup Canvas has been embeded in the page as a demonstration of what could be done with all of the digitized tools. 

This site is publicly visible, hosted on Github Pages. Visit the site here: https://finlabuncdf.github.io

*Note: There is an exact copy of the original version of the Toolsite code here: https://github.com/finlabuncdf/toolkit
