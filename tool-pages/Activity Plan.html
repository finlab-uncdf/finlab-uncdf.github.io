						<p>The Activity Plan is a tool that helps teams outline tasks, and assign resources and people to these tasks.The plan also helps connect higher-level goals with detailed activities . </p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>USE CASES</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Build a future calendar of activities for a team.</li>
<li>Set clear milestones for organisers or managers to check-in with teams.</li>
<li>Clarify expectations, roles, and responsibilities for individuals and groups.</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>LIMTATIONS</h2>
						
						<p>The Activity Plan is only as effective as the amount of detail teams are willing to share. It is for teams to decide on the level of detail suited for them.</p>

					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>The ‘<span>Timeline</span>’ section can be filled following 3-6-9-12 months or adjusted as per the participant's choice. These timeline milestones should be spaced in a manner that best reflects the momentum of the project.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Tasks to be Completed</span>’ section is where the tasks/activities to be completed are listed down. This listing should be based on realistic estimation of what can be completed. Any activities that could stretch the team, and risk delay should be clearly called out. </li>
<li>The ‘<span>Resources Needed</span>’ section is where resources needed -  financial, material or people - to complete tasks are to be noted.</li>
<li>‘<span>Teams Involved</span>’ are the teams directly responsible for the tasks to be completed. </li>

<li><span>Outline a timeline:</span> Discuss with your team members and make a note of activities under each milestone.</li>
<li><span>Allocate Resources:</span> Identify resources needed to complete tasks - keeping the timeline, and present constraints on resources in mind.</li>
<li><span>Build consensus:</span> Discuss the plan with the team, and agree on timelines, activities, and owners.</li>

					<h2><span>HOW TO</span> FOR FACILITATORS</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck). </li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Start with participants’ existing knowledge of their activities and tasks to help them create an initial version of the plan.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants walk you through their plan and help them space out activities/timelines as needed.</li>
</ol>
				</div>
				
				<div class="f-question-bank">
					<h2>FACILITATORS QUESTION BANK</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Are the timelines listed realistic? Do they fit within the time between known milestones - like upcoming bootcamps?</li>
<li>Does the team have the capability to complete the tasks/activities within the given timeframes?</li>
<li>Does the intent of the team match the activities and resources they plan to commit to?</li>
<li>Can the team add more detail - call out assumptions and risks - to the map for a more well defined project management plan?</li>
