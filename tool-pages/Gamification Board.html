						<h1>Gamification Board</h1>

					<div class="tool-about">
						
						<p>Gamified Board is a tool to help designers think through the application of gamification principles for their product or service design solutions. Gamification is a technique that borrows from techniques that game designers use to engage players, and applies these approaches to non-game experiences to motivate actions. The board summaries the classical elements of gamification and works as an ideation framework. </p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>USE CASES</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Create a new service or product experience with gamified elements as a way to differentiate experience.</li>
<li>Introduce gamification as a part of current product or service experience as a way to improve engagement </li>
<li>Note: The Gamification Board is a starting point for actual gamified elements to be designed, and tested as prototypes - it is in a sense a planning and scoping tool. </li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>
						
						<p>Gamification is often looked at as a comprehensive answer to all customer engagement needs. It is only one type of approach. It should be used sparingly and thoughtfully. It does not guarantee better customer engagement in itself - especially if the core value proposition and features are weak. </p>

					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>‘<span>‘<span>Broad Goal</span>’ is the strategic reason gamification is being chosen as a strategy - increasing engagement, forming habits, differentiating experience etc. could be some goals to consider. </li>
<li>‘<span>Game Dynamics</span>’ are the broad strategies that designers use to realise gamification. Among these are - 1) Competition: Creating a sense of competition at individual and team level helps increase engagement. 2) Collaboration: Creating a sense of community and collaboration engages users, and motivates them. 3) Progress & Achievement: A journey that signifies growth and evolution for individuals and teams engages people. 4) Exploration and Surprise: A certain unpredictability and sens of adventure engages people.</li>
<li>‘<span>Game Mechanics</span>’ are specific tactics that help designers realise game dynamics. Among these are - 1) ‘<span>Missions</span>’: Create a sense of progress, and help navigate users towards a desired end state - for example, financial planning could be broken down into short term, mid term and long term missions. 2) ‘<span>Levels</span>’: Stages into which Missions are broken down - for example, financial planning may have levels such as - basic, adequate, excellent. 3) ‘<span>Tasks</span>’: Activities within levels that are need to be completed to move Levels and complete Missions - for example, planning in the short term may mean investing in deposits, insurance, equity funds etc. 4) ‘<span>Points</span>’: Keep score of tasks, levels, and missions completed - for example, financial investments of different types fetch different points for users. 5) ‘<span>Badges</span>’: Indicators of accomplishment that go beyond points - for example, for financial planners - someone who invests regularly could get a badge of ‘<span>responsible investor</span>’, someone else who tries new investments could get one that says - 'the adventurer' etc. 6) ‘<span>Leaderboards</span>’: Bring alive the sense of competition by showing where individuals and teams stand vis a vis each other interms of points, badges, progress level etc.</li>

							<h2>STEP BY STEP</h2>
						</div>
						
						<ol>
<li><span>Familiarise yourself:</span> Read through the template and discuss the broad goal of gamification.</li>
<li><span>Game Dynamics:</span> Choose the game dynamics that you want to create. List out why these dynamics are important to create and how they will be created. </li>
<li><span>Missions, Levels & Tasks:</span> Break down the game dynamics into missions, levels and tasks that users will have to complete as a way of participating in the gamified experience. </li>
<li><span>Points, Badges & Leaderboards:</span> List out when, why and how many points and badges will be awarded to users for participating in missions, levels, and tasks. Outline how leaderboards and dashboards will be used to inform users.</li>
<li><span>Review & Discuss:</span> Discuss the gamified concept that can be derived from the board.</li>

					<h2><span>HOW TO</span> FOR FACILITATORS</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Start with a discussion on gamification and the teams’ awareness of the concept. Take the participants through the broad framework, and engage them in discussion on how gamification may or may not be relevant to them.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants walk through the worksheet and probe them on how they will translate their strategy on gamification into prototypes and experiments. </li>

					<h2>FACILITATORS QUESTION BANK</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>What do you understand by gamification? Are there aspects of your current solution that you would say are gamified? Have you seen or experienced any gamification? What can you learn from there?</li>
<li>Are you planning to gamify what you do currently? Or are you using this as an opportunity to completely rethink the way the solution is structured? </li>
<li>What are the biggest risks in the adoption of gamification? Will it distract you and the user? </li>
<li>What is the broad goal for gamification of your solution?</li>
<li>How does the broad goal translate into choice of game dynamics?</li>
<li>How do you want to approach game mechanics? </li>
<li>What are the most important missions you want users to complete? Will these missions be engaging and meaningful for users?</li>
<li>How are you breaking down missions into specific levels and tasks? Why are the tasks important? </li>
<li>How are you awarding points and badges to users? Are these awards exciting and valuable?</li>
<li>What kind of leaderboards and dashboards are you considering? </li>
<li>How will you comminicate with users? How will you let them know that your solution is gamified?</li>
