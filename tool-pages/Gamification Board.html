						<h1>Gamification Board</h1>

					<div class="tool-about">
						
						<p>Gamification is a concept that borrows from techniques that game designers use to engage players. It applies the same kind of approach to non-game experiences — to motivate and engage users. The Gamification Board is a tool that helps designers think through the application of gamification principles as part of their product or service experience.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>USE CASES</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Create a new service or product experience with gamified elements as a way to differentiate experience.</li>
<li>Introduce gamification as a part of the current product or service experience as a way to improve engagement.</li>
<li>Note: The Gamification Board is a starting point for actual gamified elements to be designed, and tested as prototypes - It is in a sense a planning and scoping tool.</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>
						
						<p>Gamification is often looked at as a comprehensive answer to all customer engagement needs. However, it is only one type of approach, and should be used sparingly and thoughtfully. Gamification does not guarantee better customer engagement, especially if the core value proposition and experience are weak.</p>

					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>‘<span>Broad Goal</span>’ is the core strategic reason gamification is being chosen as a strategy; Increasing engagement, forming habits, differentiating experience, etc. could be some goals to consider.</li>
<li>‘<span>Game Dynamics</span>’ are the strategies that designers use to realise gamification. Among these are - 1) Competition: Creating a sense of competition at individual and team level 2) Collaboration: Creating a sense of community and collaboration among users 3) Progress & Achievement: Offering journeys that signify growth and evolution for individuals and teams 4) Exploration and Surprise: Creating unpredictability and sense of adventure through gamification.</li>
<li>‘<span>Game Mechanics</span>’ are specific tactics that help designers realise game dynamics. Among these are - 1) ‘<span>Missions</span>’: Create a sense of progress, and help navigate users towards a desired end state. For example, financial planning could be broken down into short term, mid term and long term missions 2) ‘<span>Levels</span>’: Stages into which Missions are broken down. For example, financial planning may have levels such as basic, adequate, excellent 3) ‘<span>Tasks</span>’: Activities within levels that need to be completed to move from one Level to another, and to complete Missions. For example, planning in the short term may mean investing $200 in deposits, insurance, equity funds etc 4) ‘<span>Points</span>’: Scores assigned for completion of tasks, levels, and missions. For example, 100 points for every $10 invested. 5) ‘<span>Badges</span>’: Indicators of accomplishment that go beyond points. For example, someone who invests regularly could get a badge of ‘<span>responsible investor</span>’ 6) ‘<span>Leaderboards</span>’: Dashboards that show where individuals and teams stand vis-a-vis each other in terms of points, badges, progress level, etc.</li>

							<h2>STEP BY STEP</h2>
						</div>
						
						<ol>
<li><span>Familiarise yourself:</span> Read through the template and discuss the broad goal of gamification.</li>
<li><span>Identify game dynamics:</span> Choose the game dynamics that you want to create. List out why these dynamics are important to create and how they will be created.</li>
<li><span>Map missions, levels and tasks:</span> Break down the game dynamics into missions, levels and tasks that users will have to complete as a way of participating in the gamified experience.</li>
<li><span>Identify points, badges and leaderboards:</span> List out when, why and how many points and badges will be awarded to users for participating in missions, levels, and tasks. Outline how leaderboards and dashboards will be used to inform users.</li>
<li><span>Review and discuss:</span> Discuss the gamified concept that can be derived from the board.</li>

					<h2><span>HOW TO</span> FOR FACILITATORS</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure participants understand the goal of the activity and the direction. Refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck.</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Start with a discussion on gamification and the teams’ awareness of the concept. Take the participants through the broad framework, and engage them in discussion on how gamification may or may not be relevant to them.</li>
<li><span>At the close:</span> Have participants walk through the worksheet, and probe them on how they could translate their broad strategy into prototypes and experiments.</li>
</ol>

				<div class="f-question-bank">
					<h2>FACILITATORS QUESTION BANK</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>What do you understand by gamification? Are there aspects of your current solution that you would say are gamified? Have you seen or experienced any gamification? What can you learn from there?</li>
<li>Are you planning to gamify what you do currently? Or are you using this as an opportunity to completely rethink the way the solution is structured?</li>
<li>What are the biggest risks in the adoption of gamification? Will it distract you and the user?</li>
<li>What is the broad goal for gamification of your solution? How does the broad goal translate into choice of game dynamics?</li>
<li>Which game mechanics do you intend on using?</li>
<li>What are the most important missions you want users to complete? Will these missions be engaging and meaningful for users?</li>
<li>How are you breaking down missions into specific levels and tasks? Why are the tasks important for you?</li>
<li>How are you awarding points and badges to users? Are they exciting and valuable?</li>
<li>What kind of leaderboards are you considering?</li>
<li>How will you communicate with users? How will you let them know that your solution is gamified?</li>
