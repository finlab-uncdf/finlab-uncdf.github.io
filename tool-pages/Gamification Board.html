						<h2>About</h2>
						
						<p>Gamified Board is a tool to help designers think through the application of gamification principles in their product or service design solutions. The board summaries the classical elements of gamification and works as an ideation framework. Gamification is a technique that borrows from approaches that game designers use to engage players, and applies these approaches to non-game experiences to motivate actions. Gamification is all about enhancing engagement of users and usually used as a front end layers that works in tandem with core product or service features. 
</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>Use Cases</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>The Gamified Board can be used to define a new service or product experience with gamified elements as a way to differentiate user experience.</li>
<li>Or define gamification as a part of current product or service experience as a way to improve engagement. </li>
<li>Note: The board is a starting point for actual game elements to be designed and tested as prototypes.</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>Limitations</h2>
						
						<p>Gamification is often mistakenly taken as a comprehensive answer to all customer engagement needs. It is only one type of approach. It should be used sparingly and thoughtfully. It does not guarantee better customer engagement in itself - especially if the core value proposition and features are weak. </p>

					<h2>Understand</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Broad Goal' is the strategic reason gamification is being chosen as a strategy - increasing engagement, forming habits, differentiating experience etc. could be some such goals to consider. It could also be defined as what you want the user to accomplish, for example - sound financial planning. </li>
<li>'Game Dynamics' are some of the specific goals that gamification would help achieve and that can be the guiding elements for levels and tasks. Among these are:</li>
<li>Competition: Creating a sense of competition amongst users could help achieve the broad goal.  At individual and team level, competition could help accelerate use and increase engagement. </li>
<li>Collaboration: When creating a sense of community and collaboration helps achieve the broad goal. Important to consider who the collaboration is between and what it helps achieve that individuals can</span>’t.</li>
<li>Progress & Achievement: The journey/path that signifies growth and evolution for individuals and teams. </li>
<li>Exploration and Surprise:  Complimenting progress could be aspects that enhance the sense of exploration and adventure for overall game engagement. </li>
<li>'Game Mechanics' are specific tactics that help realise the game dynamics and goal. </li>
<li>Missions: Missions are  journeys that bring the sense of progress alive. They help navigate users towards a desired end state. For example - financial planning could be broken down into short term, mid term and long term missions. </li>
<li>Levels: Levels are stages in which mission are broken down. For example - short term financial planning may mean creating levels such as - basic, adequate, well planned, excellent. </li>
<li>Tasks: Specific activities within missions that are closely tied to the overall purpose of gamification. For example - planning in the  short term may mean investing in certain kinds of  deposits, insurance, equity funds etc. </li>
<li>Points: Points help keep score and establish status in terms of progress. For example - each investment in financial products could fetch points (real or virtual) for user.</li>
<li>Badges: An indicator of accomplishment that goes beyond points. For example as a financial planner - someone who invests regularly could get a badge saying ‘<span>responsible investor</span>’. </li>
<li>Leaderboards: They help bring the sense of competition alive by showing the progress vis a vis other users/players.</li>

							<h2>Step by Step</h2>
						</div>
						
						<ol>
<li><span>Familiarise yourself:</span> Read through the template and discuss the broad goal of gamification.</li>
<li><span>Game Dynamics:</span> Choose the game dynamics that you want to create. List out why these dynamics are important to create and how they will be created. </li>
<li><span>Missions, Levels & Tasks:</span> Break down the game dynamics into missions, levels and tasks that users will have to complete as a way of participating into the game play. </li>
<li><span>Points, Badges & Leaderboards:</span> List out when, why and how many points and badges will be awarded to users for completing missions, levels, and tasks. Outline how leaderboards and dashboards will be used to inform users.</li>
<li><span>Review & Discuss:</span> Review the game concept that can be developed on the board. Discuss if the concept is exciting and how it can be translated into prototypes and testable assets. </li>

					<h2>How to for Facilitators</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Start with a discussion on gamification and the teams’ awareness of the concept. Take the participants through the broad framework and communicate that the exercise would help them think through how they could gamify a part or whole of  their solution. Engage them in discussion on how gamification may or may not be relevant to them, and that it doesn’t need to be done as a one size fits all sort of solution. </li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants walk through the worksheet and probe them on how they will translate the broad strategy on gamification as outlined in the exercise, into specific prototypes and experiments. </li>
</ol>

					<h2>Facilitators Question Bank</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>What do you understand by gamification? Are there aspects of your current solution that you would say are gamified? Have you seen or experienced any gamification? What can you learn from there?</li>
<li>Are you planning to gamify what you do currently? Or are you using this as an opportunity to completely rethink the way the solution is structured? </li>
<li>What are the biggest risks in the adoption of gamification? Will it distract you and the user? </li>
<li>What is the broad goal that provides a rationale for why gamification is worth trying for your solution?</li>
<li>How does the broad goal translate into game dynamics? Why are you choosing these  dynamics? </li>
<li>How are your goal and choice of dynamics translating into game mechanics? </li>
<li>What are the most important missions you want users to complete? Are these missions engaging and meaningful for users?</li>
<li>How are you breaking down missions into specific levels and tasks? Why are the tasks important? Do they move the user towards the actions you want them to take? Or, are they distracting?</li>
<li>How are you awarding points and badges to users? Are these awards exciting and valuable?</li>
<li>How are you informing users? What kind of leaderboards and dashboards are you considering? </li>
