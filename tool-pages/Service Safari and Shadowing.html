						<h1>Service Safari and Shadowing</h1>
						
						<p class="time">30 Min+</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-about">						
						<p>The Service Safari tool allows researchers to step into the shoes of users by experiencing a service or system themselves. First hand experience helps researchers develop a robust understanding of the joys and pain points felt by users. Shadowing is similar but involves researchers accompanying someone as they go through a product or service journey, and discussing their experience with them. </p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>USE CASES</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Understand a user's experience better</li>
<li>Identify the various steps involved in a given experience or service</li>
<li>Learn about possible workarounds and hacks that users may have developed to suit their needs</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>LIMTATIONS</h2>
						
						<p>A single service safari or shadowing session may throw up limited insight. Different locations and sets of people may offer different experiences. In addition, it is crucial that researchers take a realistic view of experience and do not project their own biases and preferences. While shadowing, being judgement-free and respectful is crucial - respondents should feel empowere to share their experiences in an honest and open manner. </p>

					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>A user experience journey is broken down into specific steps - ‘<span>Step 1</span>’, ‘<span>Step 2</span>’, ‘<span>Step 3</span>’ etc., in order to map observations in an end-to-end manner.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Details</span>’ column questions such as ‘<span>What did you do?</span>’ or ‘<span>What did you like or dislike?</span>’ which are prompts for researchers to note their observations and experiences through the journey.</li>

							<h2>STEP BY STEP</h2>
						</div>
						
						<ol>
<li><span>Choose a tool:</span> Choose between the Shadowing or Service Safari approach, depending on the research context.</li>
<li><span>Find a respondent:</span> Recruit a participant willing to be accompanied (for shadowing) and document their actions as they go through the journey. If you are doing it yourself then decide how you will document it. </li>
<li><span>Map the user experience:</span> List down the distinct steps, actions, objects, people that constitute the experience.</li>
<li><span>Ask questions:</span> After the experience has been completed - you can revisit steps you'd like to learn more about.</li>

					<h2><span>HOW TO</span> FOR FACILITATORS</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Explain the activity to participants and check if they intend to use shadowing or service safari or both. </li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> If accompanying participants on the field, encourage them to look for unexpected details that might otherwise get missed.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants share their observations and ask them to highlight what they found to be the most interesting or surprising.</li>
</ol>

				<div class="f-question-bank">
					<h2>FACILITATORS QUESTION BANK</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Does the team plan to use one or both tools?</li>
<li>Which part of the journey are you looking to observe and learn more about?</li>
<li>Who will be going through the experience? Have you identified a user?</li>
<li>Have you experienced a similar service or system before? What expectations are you carrying to the field?</li>
<li>Wht is the most important thing you want to learn from this exercise?</li>
<li>How will you make sure you are respectful and unobstrusive during research?</li>
<li>How did it go? Were you able to plot all the key steps of the experience?</li>
<li>What did you learn about the different steps? Is there something you'd like to understand better?</li>
<li>Which step of the journey is most challenging for users? Do you have any immediate thoughts on how it could be improved?</li>
