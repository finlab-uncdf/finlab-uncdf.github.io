						<h1>Service Blueprint</h1>
						
						<p class="time">60 Min</p>

					<div class="tool-about">						
						<p>A Service Blueprint is an expanded version of the Journey Map. While a Journey Map captures the essence of the user journey, focuses on key user actions, and helps map moments of positive and negative experience - the Service Blueprint brings in the added dimension of the service provider journey that runs parallel to the one the user is experiencing. From the Blueprint's point of view - the user side of the experience is the front-end, and the service provider side of the experience is the back-end. The tool helps service providers establish the connect between front-end experience, and back-end processes and systems - helping identify opportunities for improvement and investment. </p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>USE CASES</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Create a holistic service solution that accounts for both front-end, and back-end elements.</li>
<li>Identify new back-end processes and systems that may be needed to offer a future user experience.</li>
<li>Evaluate how back-end processes and systems may be impacting current user experience.</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>
						
						<p>Connecting front-end and back-end activities and processes on the Service Blueprint can be often confusing and cumbersome. The stages on the template are just one way to think of the journey - teams using the the tool should customise it for their own purpose.</p>

					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>In the top most row of the template, there are three broad phases called out - Awareness Building, Service Delivery, and Retention - these are classic user journey phases - it is okay for the team to continue with these or reframe. A designer may choose to focus on the entire end-to-end journey or just one part of it.</li>
<li>'User Touchpoints' are the key user tasks and interactions that comprise the front-end experience. To build detail, it is recommended that designers call out people interactions, objects, environments, and messaging that together make up this front-end experience.</li>
<li>'Service Touchpoints' are the key service provider tasks, processes and systems that comprise the back-end. There may be objects, environments, and messaging that are part of both the user and service provider end - for example, a check in form at a hotel is used by users to declare details about themselves, and is also used by service providers to keep a record of their customers. It is important for designers to make connections between the front and back-end at this level of detail.</li>
<li>'External Actors' are third party vendors, partners, and stakeholders who have a strong influence on back-end systems and processes, and sometimes even on front-end experience - for example, a third party cab provider who offers airport pickups and drops for hotel guests.</li>

							<h2>STEP BY STEP</h2>
						</div>
						
						<ol>
<li><span>Map the User Journey:</span> Start by creating a Journey Map with key touchpoints and interactions that a user experiences. This could be of an existing journey or a future journey.</li>
<li><span>Map the Service Provider Journey:</span> Once all the steps at the user side have been clearly listed, map the key actions and systems from the service provider point of view. Also, identify any third party/external partner dependencies for the service provider.</li>
<li><span>Review the Blueprint:</span> Ensure the Blueprint captures front and back end aspects of the experience in as much detail as possible. Discuss how the two may be impacting or could potentially impact each other.</li>

					<h2><span>HOW TO</span> FOR FACILITATORS</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure participants understand the goal of the activity and the key parts of the template.</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Help participants map their user journey first, and then connect back-end processes and systems to the different user experience stages. Check if any external actors are involved.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants walk you through their Blueprints. If this is a mapping of an existing service, ask them to highlight key pain points and challenges. If they are building a future service blueprint - ask them how they may have worked out previously identified opportunities and challenges.</li>
</ol>
				</div>
				
				<div class="f-question-bank">
					<h2>FACILITATORS QUESTION BANK</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>If our focus is on current experiences, do we have enough information to build the blueprint Do we know enough about the front-end and back-end?</li>
<li>Is the user journey specific to a particular user type or is it generic and applicable to all types of users?</li>
<li>What are the steps of the journey that we want to cover? Where does it start? Where does it end? Which are the steps we are the clearest about?</li>
<li>What does the user do at each of the steps?</li>
<li>What are the objects, environments, interactions, and messaging that together make up the front-end experience?</li>
<li>What are the complimentary service provider actions at each step? What are the key processes, systems that are operating in the back-end for the service provider?</li>
<li>How do external actors contribute to the service experience? Do they have direct impact on both back-end and front-end?</li>
<li>How will the reimagined service blueprint tackle previously identified opportunities and challenges?</li>
