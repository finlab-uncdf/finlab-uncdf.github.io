						<h2>About</h2>
						
						<p>The POEMS tool is used to capture observations in the field. A lot can be learned from observing existing services like public transit, banks, dining spaces. POEMS works like a checklist of things to look for and observe.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>Use Cases</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Understanding how users interact with an existing product or service.</li>
<li>Getting a broad systems understanding of the dynamics and stakeholders at work in any given service.</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>Limitations</h2>
						
						<p>Observational research is good to observe physical environments. For using similar methods when working with digital products or device-based services, consider the Shadowing activity.</p>

					<h2>Understand</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>The ‘<span>Objects</span>’ section of the tool is where observations pertaining to physical objects or touchpoints that constitute the experience being observed. Participants should list all the objects or devices they can see that are relevant to the service being observed.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Environment</span>’ section of the map is where notes regarding the physical space and setting should be written down. Jot down the distinct aspects of environments within the context being observed.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>People</span>’ section refers to the people involved within the users experiences and their interactions with them. Who is part of providing the service? What are they doing? Why are they here?</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Services</span>’ section looks at the systems, processes and services involved within the experience being observed. Although the observer may be intending to study one service (for example using public transit), that very service might involve many more smaller services (payment methods, wayfinding apps, advertisements marketed along the way).</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Messaging</span>’ section looks at the communication the user sees and interacts with through the experience. This can be signage, video screens, pamphlets.</li>

							<h2>Step by Step</h2>

						<ol>
<li><span>Pick a place and time:</span> Decide a time and place to conduct the observations at, this should be informed by the research plan.</li>
<li><span>Collect initial observations:</span> Write down observations from the field into the respective boxes in the tool.</li>
<li><span>Ask why:</span> Once you‘ve completed the template, ask yourself why things are the way they are. These will remain assumptions but will help broaden your thinking regarding the topic at hand.</li>

					<h2>How to for Facilitators</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Explain the activity to the participants, explaining that they should write down any observations that they spot.</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> If present with the participants in the field, help them with spotting observations and writing them down in the correct areas of the tool.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants share their observations and ask them to highlight what they found to be the most interesting or surprising.</li>

					<h2>Facilitators Question Bank</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Have you chosen a place or a setting to observe the user experience? How well does it meet the needs of your Research Plan?</li>
<li>Are there multiple settings/situations from where you can observe the user experience from?</li>
<li>Have you noted down all observations related to the user experience?</li>
<li>What are the most notable observations you have recorded?</li>
<li>Is there any part of the experience you would like to observe in greater detail?</li>
