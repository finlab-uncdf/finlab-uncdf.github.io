					<div class="tool-about">						
						<p>The POEMS tool is used to record observations in the field. A lot can be learned from observing the way people interact with and use services and systems like public transit systems, banks, restaurants, airports, waste management, etc. Observations add depth to conversations and are often able to document real behaviours better. POEMS works like a checklist for researchers when they are on the field.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>USE CASES</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Understand how users interact with existing products and services.</li>
<li>Build a broad understanding of service provider systems and tasks.</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>
						
						<p>POEMS is a good tool to map behaviours and systems in the physical domain. While working on digital products, Shadowing and Service Safaris may be better suited.</p>

					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>The ‘<span>People</span>’ section refers to the people involved. For example, these could be users, service providers, vendors and partners, and other stakeholders (like govt staff or police). Researchers should describe the roles and behaviours of the people observed.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Objects</span>’ section of the tool is where observations pertaining to physical objects or touch-points that are part of the experience are to be recorded. Researchers should list objects as comprehensively as possible, focused first on things directly involved in the user journey, and then those that play a supporting part.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Environment</span>’ section of the map is where notes regarding the physical space and setting should be written down. The type of space, the layout, the mood or tone of the space, etc. can be the kind of things that researchers could record.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Messaging</span>’ section looks at communication targeted at the user in the observed space. Messaging could be physical, branding signage, advertising, sales material, or it could be delivered through conversations between users and service staff.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Services</span>’ section looks at the systems and processes that form part of the experience. Although the observer may be intending to study one service (for example using public transit), that very service might involve many more smaller services (payment methods, luggage handling, ticket purchase, check in-check out, etc).</li>

							<h2>STEP BY STEP</h2>
						</div>
						
						<ol>
<li><span>Pick a place and time:</span> Decide a time and place to conduct the observations, be informed by the research plan.</li>
<li><span>Collect initial observations:</span> Write down observations from your surroundings into the respective boxes in the tool. For each box, challenge yourself to go beyond the obvious:</span> list everything you see at first glance, then give it another shot and add to each box something you hadn't noticed the first time around. Keep doing that until your documentation is comprehensive.</li>
<li><span>Ask why:</span> Once you've completed the template, ask yourself why things are the way they are, and record learnings from discussion.</li>

					<h2><span>HOW TO</span> FOR FACILITATORS</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Explain the activity to the participants, explaining that they should write down any observations that they spot.</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> If accompanying participants in the field, help them with spotting observations and writing them down in the correct areas of the tool.</li>
<li><span>At the close:</span> Have participants share their observations and ask them to highlight what they found to be the most interesting or surprising.</li>

					<h2>FACILITATORS QUESTION BANK</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Have you chosen a place or a setting to observe users?</li>
<li>Are there diverse situations where one can observe different kinds of user experience journeys?</li>
<li>What part of the POEMS framework are you least sure about?</li>
<li>How will you ensure that your observation is successful? Will you be accompanying certain users? Or, will you be generally observing?</li>
<li>What are the most notable observations you have recorded?</li>
<li>Is there any part of the experience you would like to observe in greater detail?</li>
