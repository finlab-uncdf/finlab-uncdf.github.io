						<p>Design Principles help build a shared vision for the solution within the team. They are rules and constraints that help teams decide what to do, and what not to do as they move towards finding a solution.</p>

						<h2>Use Cases</h2>

<li>Aligning the team‘s vision moving forward.</li>

<li>The aim of the activity is for participants to reflect as a team on the intended outcome or solution they‘<span>d like to work towards. Each question box in this activity is meant to encourage discussion. Participants can choose to answer each of them or focus on the ones of their choosing.</li>
<li> ‘<span>Who We Must Focus On / Avoid</span>’ should help identify any core need the team would like to tackle or solve for.</li>
<li>‘<span>How We Must Act / Not Act</span>’ should address any concerns of scale, approach, funding strategies that will affect how the project is run.</li>
<li>‘<span>Where We Must Act / Not Act</span>’ should identify geographies,  industries, institutions, and platforms to be active in or on.</li>
<li>‘<span>When We Must Act / Not Act</span>’ should address any concern of immediacy or sustainability of the effort over longer periods of time.</li>
<li>Why We Must Act / Not Act should address the motivations of the project.</li>
<li>‘<span>Prioritised Principles</span>’ should clearly call out the five strongest statements that the whole team can rally around.</li>
