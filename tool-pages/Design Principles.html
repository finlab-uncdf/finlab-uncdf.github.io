						<p>Design Principles help build a shared vision for the solution within the team. They are rules and constraints that help teams decide what to do, and what not to do as they move towards finding a solution.</p>

						<h2>USE CASES</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Align the team's vision moving forward</li>

						<h2>LIMTATIONS</h2>
						
						<p>Especially, in multi-disciplinary settings - defining design principles can be challenging. It is not easy to agree on what must and must not be done. Defined principles can also sometimes feel too idealistic and open ended, or constrained. It is important for a team to revisit principles and iterate if the principles are failing to serve as a useful guide. </p>

					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Design principles help guide teams as they look at creating products and services. Each question box in this activity is meant to encourage discussion.</li>
<li>‘<span>Who We Must Focus On / Avoid</span>’ should help a team prioritise the users and stakeholders they want to focus the solution on.</li>
<li>‘<span>How We Must Act / Not Act</span>’ should help a team define the kind of processes and systems they want to adopt.</li>
<li>‘<span>Where We Must Act / Not Act</span>’ should help a team define the geographical or thematic focus of their solution.</li>
<li>‘<span>When We Must Act / Not Act</span>’ should help a team define the timescale - short or long term, periodic or continous etc. - that they want to work on.</li>
<li>‘<span>Why We Must Act / Not Act</span>’ should help a team define their core mission.</li>
<li>‘<span>Prioritised Principles</span>’ should clearly call out the five strongest principles that the team wants to rally around.</li>

					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Have everyone review the questions as a team, make sure at least one person is writing down suggestions.</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Help the participants navigate any disagreement. Encourage participants to move to another question if they are getting stuck.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants choose five principles to move forward with.</li>

					<h2>FACILITATORS QUESTION BANK</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>What does the word 'principles' mean to you?</li>
<li>Can you list 2-3 principles that may be driving your organizations and teams right now?</li>
<li>Are you looking at organizational/programme level principles? Or at specific product and service principles?</li>
<li>As you are thinking through the questions - is there any in particular that strikes a chord? Is there any you are struggling with?</li>
<li>Where does the team have most amount of consensus? Where in this process is there disagreement amongst the team?</li>
<li>What are emerging as the most important 2-3 principles?</li>
