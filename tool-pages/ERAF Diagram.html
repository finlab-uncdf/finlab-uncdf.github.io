						<p>ERAF Diagrams are often referred to as system maps. They are used to represent complex ecosystems that involve multiple Entities (people, organisations, systems). The ERAF diagram documents the Attributes (descriptions, roles, needs) of the chosen Entities, helps call out Relationships (connections) between them, and describes the Flows (the nature of relationships) between the Entities. Together, the diagram focuses on some of the most aspects required to understand and design for a system. </p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>USE CASES</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Visualise a current ecosystem and describe its true nature.</li>
<li>Study relationships and interdependency between entities.</li>
<li>Imagine a future system with current or new entities.</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>
						
						<p>This isn't a one-size-fits-all synthesis method, so it may not work for all situations - especially where no systems are being consciously studied. Other tools in the Define phase may be better suited for certain research contexts. </p>

					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>‘<span>Entities</span>’ are definable parts of the system. For example, physical entities could be people, places, and things, or conceptual such as projects, problems, or goals.</li>
<li>‘<span>Relationships</span>’ describe how the entities connect with one another. They describe the nature of the connection.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Attributes</span>’ are characteristics of any entity or relation. Qualitative Attributes could be names, brands, perceptions, whereas Quantitative Attributes could be age, size, cost, duration or any other measurable element.</li>
<li>‘<span>Flows</span>’ help understand the true nature of relationships between entities. Flows could be of people, material, finance, information etc. - moving from one entity to another.</li>
</ul>

							<h2>STEP BY STEP</h2>
						</div>
						
						<ol>
<li><span>Identify entities:</span> List down all entities present in the system being researched. Write their names on sticky notes. Place them on a wall or printed template.</li>
<li><span>Define attributes:</span> Describe key attributes of each of the entities - use one or more sticky notes to do this.</li>
<li><span>Describe relationships:</span> Start connecting entities that are related. Provide space on the board in a way that the connecting lines do not get messy. Describe the relationships on sticky notes - key strengths, weaknesses etc.</li>
<li><span>Describe flows:</span> Describe the specific nature of exchange between entities - human, material, informational, financial, influence etc.</li>

					<h2><span>HOW TO</span> FOR FACILITATORS</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Explain the activity to participants - take them through the different parts of the tool. If this is a sense making exercise - ask them to document what they know. If ERAF is being used to imagine a new system - engage them accordingly.</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Help participants define various parts of the map. Help them visualise the maps in a clear and organised manner.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants share their maps, and have them point out any interesting insights they may have come up with.</li>
</ol>

				<div class="f-question-bank">
					<h2>FACILITATORS QUESTION BANK</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Why do you want to use the ERAF map? Will it help you understand an existing system? or, Imagine a new system?</li>
<li>Can you define all the entities from the system you have studied? Are they all at the same conceptual level?</li>
<li>What are they attributes or characteristics that can describe the entities?</li>
<li>What is the nature of the relationships between the entities? Can you show the connections?</li>
<li>After you have connected the entities - which entities are emerging as the most connected and critical?</li>
<li>What is the nature of the relationships - what kind of flows are taking place between the entities?</li>
<li>Are you capturing all kinds of flows - human, material, knowledge, financial etc.?</li>
<li>Are you using different colors or line types to visualise different kinds of flows?</li>
<li>What are your most important learnings from the system mapping? What are some new things you may have learnt?</li>
</ul>
