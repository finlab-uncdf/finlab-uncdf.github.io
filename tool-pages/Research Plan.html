						<h1>Research Plan</h1>
						
						<p class="time">90 Min</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-about">
						
						<p>A well framed research plan is crucial to successful research. It makes sure the team stays aligned on learning objectives and the research methods to be used. By visually mapping the research methods along the lines of inquiry, specific tools, specific questions, participant profiles, and responsibilities - the tool helps teams visualise the scope and scale of research, and clarifies roles.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>USE CASES</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Define lines of inquiry for research.</li>
<li>Identify research activities and tools to be used.</li>
<li>Assign role and responsibilities within the research team.</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>
						
						<p>Creating a Research Plan can help build consensus but can also feel a little overwhelming, the participants should make sure they are being realistic - and cover critical inquiries emerging from exercises such as Problem Tree and Stakeholder Mapping.</p>

					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>The ‘<span>Key lines of Enquiry</span>’ are derived from the Foundation phase, where tools such as the Problem Tree+5 Whys and the Stakeholder Map highlight information gaps, opportunities and other potential themes for research.</li>
<li>‘<span>Research Methods</span>’ are the broad and specific research tools and techniques that the team wants to use. These tools include - Secondary Research, User Research, Observation amongst others. The choice of methods is influenced by - the nature of information needed, skills and resources available in the team, access to users etc.</li>
<li>‘<span>Key Questions</span>’ are the top 2-3 questions (per line of inquiry) that the team would like to focus the enquiry on.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Research Tools</span>’ box should be used to list specific tool and techniques that are to be used under the Research Methods - Interviews, Focus Group Discussions, Expert Interviews, Internet Search, Competition Benchmark etc.</li>
<li>‘<span>Research Participants</span>’ are the users, stakeholders, and experts that the team will research with (and/or on). The actual choice of participating individuals and groups may depend on accessibility and availability.</li>
<li>‘<span>Person Responsible</span>’ is meant to allocate responsibilities within the team. A clear understanding of roles is important to cover all lines of enquiry comprehensively.</li>

							<h2>STEP BY STEP</h2>
						</div>
						
						<ol>
<li><span>Define lines of inquiry:</span> List down the critical gaps in understanding - these are the major lines of inquiry. These can be taken from the Problem Tree and Stakeholder Map or emerge from the team's previous experiences.</li>
<li><span>Identify research methodologies:</span> Map the lines of inquiry against research methodologies - discuss which methods to use and why.</li>
<li><span>Add details:</span> Add more detail and structure to the research plan - discuss specific tools and their scope, the profile of participants, and responsibilities within the team.</li>
</ol>

					<h2><span>HOW TO</span> FOR FACILITATORS</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Explain the activity to the participants, if participants are feeling stuck, help them by filling out a row with them.</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Make sure that they refer to previous tools that might have touched upon challenges and opportunities - these would help frame the key lines of enquiry. Discuss how they are framing their enquiries.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants share their plans and discuss if the research methods identified complement the lines of inquiry. Discuss confidence in using tools and help needed.</li>
</ol>

				<div class="f-question-bank">
					<h2>FACILITATORS QUESTION BANK</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>What are the top 2-3 research goals emerging from your plan?</li>
<li>Are all challenges and opportunities before you being addressed in the research plan? If not, what are you focusing on?</li>
<li>How are you choosing methods for each line of enquiry? Are there lines of enquiry that need to be covered through multiple methods?</li>
<li>Is the plan realistic? Will the team be able to successfully complete all the research tasks?</li>
<li>How are we planning to distribute responsibilities? Are we comfortable with what is on the template?</li>
<li>What is our documentation strategy? Are you planning to record interviews? How will you collate findings from the different research activities?</li>
