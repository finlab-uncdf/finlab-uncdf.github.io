					<div class="tool-about">
						
						<p>Stakeholder Maps are used to provide a sense of the ecosystem of people, institutions, organisations, and any other entities who have an influence or stake with respect to a target audience. Concentric circles are used to depict the type and distance of influence (direct or indirect). </p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>USE CASES</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Map the ecosystem of users and stakeholders relevant to a problem.</li>
<li>Identify gaps and priorities with regards to understanding an ecosystem. </li>
<li>Validate assumptions about the ecosystem as one moves forward.</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>
						
						<p>The Stakeholder Map does not exactly describe the nature of relationship between target user and the stakeholders. It also has limited ability to describe relationships between stakeholders. </p>

					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>The ‘<span>Target User</span>’ section is to be kept focused on individuals or groups that the startup or organisation is trying to solve for. </li>
<li>‘<span>Direct Influencers</span>’ are those that most influence the attitudes and behaviors of the target audience. One can also look at these influencers as those with only one degree of separation from the user - students may be influenced by their peers, college authorities, and parents while choosing a banking solution. </li>
<li>‘<span>Indirect Influencers</span>’ are those that influence the target audience but their influence may seem less obvious. There may be two or more degrees of separation between the target and these influencers - students may be influenced by celebrities, media reports, and sports advertising while choosing a banking solution. </li>
<li>‘<span>Societal Norms</span>’ are overarching forces that may not have a direct representative but are still important to take into account. For example - political climate, market trends, cultural norms.</li>

							<h2>STEP BY STEP</h2>

						<ol>
<li><span>List stakeholders:</span> The easiest way to get started is to list all the stakeholders that come to mind right away - this can be done on the sheet directly or on sticky notes.</li>
<li><span>Organise stakeholders:</span> Once the stakeholders are listed, review their placement on the map on the team. </li>
<li><span>Desribe stake and relationships:</span> Desribe the influence of the stakeholder on the user. Draw connections between stakeholders where possible to understand interdependencies. </li>

					<h2><span>HOW TO</span> FOR FACILITATORS</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Explain the activity to the participants, preferably using examples. Make sure they first start from the center and move outwards.</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Help them think of stakeholders if they get stuck. Create connections, and help them consider the influence of the stakeholders listed.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants walk you through the process of mapping. Get them to desribe the most critical influencers, and call out important interdependencies and connections they may uncovered.</li>
</ol>

					<h2>FACILITATORS QUESTION BANK</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Who have you chosen as the target user? Can you add some description so that everyone is on the same page?</li>
<li>Can you add some description of the stakeholders and the kind of influence they have on the user?</li>
<li>Which stakeholders do you think have the most influence on the target user?</li>
<li>Are there any indirect stakeholders that influence the stakeholders on your map?</li>
<li>Are there any personal connections, commercial services, government entities, that are missing from this picture?</li>
<li>What connections can we identify between the stakeholders?</li>
