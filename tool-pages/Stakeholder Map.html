					<div class="tool-about">
						<h2>About</h2>
						
						<p>Stakeholder Maps are used to provide a sense of the ecosystem of people, institutions, organisations, and any other entities who have an influence or stake with respect to a target audience. Concentric circles are used to depict the type and distance of influence (direct or indirect). </p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>Use Cases</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Understanding the ecosystem of users and stakeholders relevant to problems that the participants are attempting to understand and solve. </li>
<li>Mapping the known ecosystem, identifying gaps and priorities with regards to their understanding of the ecosystem. </li>
<li>Validating assumptions for those who do not have a complete understanding of the ecosystem as they move forward.</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>Limitations</h2>
						
						<p>The Stakeholder Map does not exactly describe the nature of relationship between target user and the stakeholders. It also has limited ability to describe relationships between stakeholders. </p>

					<h2>Understand</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>The ‘<span>Target User</span>’ section is to be kept focused on individuals or groups that the startup or organisation is trying to solution for. </li>
<li>‘<span>Direct Influencers</span>’ are those that most influence the attitudes and behaviours of the target audience. One can look at these influencers as those with only one degree of separation. For example - college students may be influenced by their peers, the retail ecosystem around them, college authorities and even their parents  in their choice of a fintech solution. </li>
<li>‘<span>Indirect Influencers</span>’ are those that somewhat influence the target audience but their impact is left direct. There are two or more degrees of separation between the target and these stakeholders. For example - looking again at college students, such influencers might be administrators, state legislation, scholarship funds etc. </li>
<li>'societal Norms</span>’ are the forces that may not have a direct representative but are still important to take into account. For example - political climate, market trends, cultural norms.</li>

							<h2>Step by Step</h2>
						</div>
						
						<ol>
<li><span>List stakeholders:</span> The easiest way to get started is to list all the stakeholders that come to mind right away.</li>
<li><span>Reorganise groups:</span> Once the stakeholders are listed, review their placement on the map with the team. There might be disagreements regarding which circle a stakeholder might fit in or the reach of their influence.</li>
<li><span>Call out dynamics:</span> The last step will be to draw connections between the stakeholders to understand their relationships. In doing so, new stakeholders should emerge. </li>

					<h2>How to for Facilitators</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Explain the activity to the participants, preferably using examples. Make sure they first start from the center and move outwards.</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Help them think of stakeholders if they get stuck or can't think of anything to write. Create connections, and think of the influences on the stakeholders written on the map.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants walk you through the process of finding connections, and point out important stakeholders/connections they found.</li>
</ol>

					<h2>Facilitators Question Bank</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Who have you chosen as the target user? Can you add a some description so that everyone is on the same page?</li>
<li>Can you add some description of the stakeholders and the kind of influence they have on the user?</li>
<li>Which stakeholders do you think have the most influence on the target user?</li>
<li>Are there any indirect stakeholders that influence the stakeholders on your map?</li>
<li>Are there any personal connections, commercial services, government entities, that are missing from this picture?</li>
<li>What connections can we identify between the stakeholders?</li>
