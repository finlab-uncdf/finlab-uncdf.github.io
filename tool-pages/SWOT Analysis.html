						<ul>
<li>Assess the overall strategic and operational well being of a product or programme.</li>

</ul>
					</div>

					<ul>
<li>Use the ‘<span>Strengths</span>’ section to highlight what the product or business does best. This can be features, pricing, process, team, partnerships, etc.</li>
<li>‘<span>Weaknesses</span>’ should cover internal shortcomings of the team or product. These could be pointed out by, both users and internal teams.</li>
<li>‘<span>Opportunities</span>’ should be used to make a note of external trends and forces that provide a positive chance for the organisation to benefit.</li>
<li>‘<span>Threats</span>’ are the external factors that pose a risk and could create potential loss for the organisation.</li>
