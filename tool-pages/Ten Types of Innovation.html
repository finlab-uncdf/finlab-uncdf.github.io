						<h2>About</h2>
						
						<p>The Ten Types of Innovation framework is a tool developed by consulting firm Doblin. It maps the fundamental types of innovations that are relevant to organisations and helps the them look at innovation as a holistic activity that can involves internal as well as customer facing investments. Supporting each type are some classical  tactics.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>Use Cases</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Mapping the types of innovation that are currently being offered by an organisation. </li>
<li>Identifying strengths and weaknesses with regards to innovation at an organisation. </li>
<li>Identifying new types of innovation that an organisation can consider. </li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>Limitations</h2>
						
						<p>While the Ten Types of Innovation tool is fairly comprehensive, it may be possible that an organisation is looking to offer innovations that are composite of the different types. Also, the tactics listed may not cover some new trends and tactics that teams may need to scan and map. </p>
