						<h1>Ten Types of Innovation</h1>

					<div class="tool-about">						
						<p>The Ten Types of Innovation framework is a tool developed by consulting firm Doblin. It maps the fundamental types of innovations that are relevant to organisations, and helps them look at innovation as a holistic activity that involves internal as well as customer facing investments. Under each type of innovation, Doblin has suggested a few strategies and tactics to use as a starting point.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>USE CASES</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Map the types of innovation that are currently being offered by an organisation. </li>
<li>Identify strengths and weaknesses with regards to innovation at an organisation. </li>
<li>Identify new types of innovation that an organisation can consider. </li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>LIMTATIONS</h2>
						
						<p>While the Ten Types of Innovation tool is fairly comprehensive, it may be possible that an organisation is looking to offer innovations that are a combination of the different types - causing some initial confusion. Also, the tactics listed may not cover some new trends that teams may need to scan and map. </p>

					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>There are three major categories of innovation under which the Ten Types fit. </li>
<li>‘<span>Configuration</span>’: Innovation that focuses on how an organisation is structured. The types of innovation that fall under this category include - 1) Profit Model: How money is made - how revenue, costs and profits are organised. 2) Network: Who an organization innovates with - how suppliers, partners, and external innovators help. 3) Structure: How an organization aligns its talent and assets to create more value - how departments, units, business lines etc. are organised. 4) Process: How superior internal processes and methods help innovation - how quality management, production, supply, procurement, hiring  etc. are designed.</li>
<li>‘<span>Offering</span>’: Innovation that focuses on the performance and quality of products and services that are offered to customers. The types that are in this category are - 1) Product Performance: How products and services can deliver superior value to buyers - unique product features and functionality, style, speed, safety, ease, fun etc. 2) Product System: How complementary products and services together create more value - accessories, platforms, value added services, partner discounts etc. </li>
<li>‘<span>Experience</span>’: Innovation that focuses on how products or services are experienced by users.  The types under this category are - 1) Service: How support is provided for users to find, buy, pay, enjoy and dispose - trials, personalisation, delivery and returns, financing, self-service, warranties, repairs etc. 2) Channel: How products and services reach users -  pop-up stores, e-commerce, partner stores, events, experience stores etc. 3) Brand: How offerings and organizations are communicated in a memorable, and likeable way - co-branding, own-label, certification, marketing campaigns, packaging, identity etc. 4) Customer Engagement: How user interactions with product or service are delivered - personalised, listening to customers, collaboration, community connect etc.</li>

							<h2>STEP BY STEP</h2>
						</div>
						
						<ol>
<li><span>Familiarise yourself:</span> Read through the various boxes of the Ten Types of Innovation. Note down what you think is the biggest differentiator in terms of innovation for your business. </li>
<li><span>Identify Key Innovations:</span> At the level of Configuration, Offering, and Experience - begin by noting down what makes the business innovative currently. If you have thoughts on what could potentially be future innovations note them down as well. </li>
<li><span>Review the Tactics:</span> Read through the tactics under each type of innovation using the ‘Tactics Cheat Sheet‘</li>
<li><span>Unpack the Innovation:</span> Next, for each type of innovation, note down what makes your business innovative currently. Follow that by noting down potential innovations to explore in the future.</li>
<li><span>Review & Brainstorm:</span> Review the mapping of current and potential innovations. Make any changes necessary to refine other boxes at the top of the sheet then brainstorm how potential innovations could be created.</li>

					<h2><span>HOW TO</span> FOR FACILITATORS</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Start with a discussion focused on what kinds of innovation are possible. Take teams through the Ten Types tool, and ask them to fill the worksheet - mapping currently adopted innovation, gaps and opportunities. </li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants walk you through the worksheet they have filled out and probe them on their mapping of both current and potential innovations.</li>

				<div class="f-question-bank">
					<h2>FACILITATORS QUESTION BANK</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>What do you associate with the word ‘innovation’? How does your organisation look at innovation?</li>
<li>Is your organisation currently innovating in terms of  internal processes, product or service performance, or experience - or a combination of these? What is your most important innovation?</li>
<li>What is the biggest gap in terms of innovation for your organisation? How do you compare to your closest competitors?</li>
<li>In terms of configuration - have you looked at internal processes and structures before or have you focused only on external facing innovations?</li>
<li>In terms of Offering and Experience - what do you know about what your customers need? Are your innovations tuned to customer needs?</li>
<li>Have you gone through the tactics? Can you identify those you have been practicing? Is there anything missing that you want to make a note of? </li>
<li>Which tactics have you considered earlier and chosen not to go forward with? Which tactics are new to you? What do you potentially want to try out?</li>
<li>Does your organization need incremental or transformational innovation?</li>
