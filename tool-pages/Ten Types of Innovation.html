						<h2>About</h2>
						
						<p>The Ten Types of Innovation framework is a tool developed by consulting firm Doblin. It maps the fundamental types of innovations that are relevant to organisations, and helps them look at innovation as a holistic activity that involves internal as well as customer facing investments. Under each type of innovation, Doblin has suggested a few strategies and tactics to use as a starting point.
</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>Use Cases</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Map the types of innovation that are currently being offered by an organisation. </li>
<li>Identify strengths and weaknesses with regards to innovation at an organisation. </li>
<li>Identify new types of innovation that an organisation can consider. </li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>Limitations</h2>
						
						<p>While the Ten Types of Innovation tool is fairly comprehensive, it may be possible that an organisation is looking to offer innovations that are a combination  of the different types. Also, the tactics listed may not cover some new trends and tactics that teams may need to scan and map. </p>

					<h2>Understand</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>There are three major categories of innovation under which the Ten Types fit. </li>
<li>Configuration: Innovation that focuses on how an organisation is structured. The types of innovation that fall under this category include - 1) Profit Model: How money is made - how revenue, costs and profits are organised. 2) Network: Who an organization innovates with - how suppliers, partners, and external innovators help. 3) Structure: How an organization aligns its talent and assets to create more value - how departments, units, business lines etc. are organised. 4) Process: How superior internal processes and methods help innovation - how quality management, production, supply, procurement, hiring  etc. are designed.</li>
<li>Offering: Innovation that focuses on the performance and quality of products and services that are offered to customers. The types that are in this category are - 1) Product Performance: How products and services can deliver superior value to buyers - unique product features and functionality, style, speed, safety, ease, fun etc. 2) Product System: How complementary products and services together create more value - accessories, platforms, value added services, partner discounts etc. </li>
<li>Experience: Innovation that focuses on how products or services are experienced by users.  The types under this category are - 1) Service:  How support is provided for users to find, buy, pay, enjoy and dispose - trials, personalisation, delivery and returns, financing, self-service, warranties, repairs etc. 2) Channel: How products and services reach users -  pop-up stores, e-commerce stores, partner stores, events, experience stores etc. 3) Brand: How offerings and businesses are communicated  in a memorable, and likeable way - co-branding, own-label, certification, marketing campaigns, brand extensions, packaging, identity etc. 4) Customer Engagement: How user interactions with product or service are delivered - personalised, listening to customers, collaboration,  community connect etc.</li>

							<h2>Step by Step</h2>
						</div>
						
						<ol>
<li><span>Familiarise yourself:</span> Read through the various boxes of the Ten Types of Innovation. Note down what you think is the biggest differentiator in terms of innovation for the business. </li>
<li><span>Identify Key Innovations:</span> At the level of Configuration, Offering, and Experience - begin by noting down what makes the business innovative currently. If you have thoughts on what could potentially be future innovations note them down as well. </li>
<li><span>Review the Tactics:</span> Read through the tactics under each type of innovation using the ‘Tactics Cheat Sheet‘</li>
<li><span>Unpack the Innovation:</span> Next,for each type of innovation, note down what makes the business innovative currently. Follow that by noting down potential innovations to explore in the future.</li>
<li><span>Review & Brainstorm:</span> Review the mapping of current and potential innovations. Make any changes necessary to refine other boxes at the top of the sheet then brainstorm how the potential innovations could be approached.</li>

<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Start with a discussion focused on what kinds of innovation are possible. Take teams through the Ten Types tool, and ask them to fill the worksheet - mapping currently adopted innovation, gaps and opportunities, and potential ideas. </li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants walk you through the worksheet they have filled out and probe them on their mapping of the current innovations and their ideas for things they can try out.</li>

					<h2>Facilitators Question Bank</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>What do you associate with the word ‘innovation’? How does your organisation look at innovation?</li>
<li>Is your organisation currently innovating in terms of  internal processes, product or service  performance, or experience - or a combination of these? What is your most important  innovation?</li>
<li>What is the biggest gap in terms of innovation for your organisation? How do you compare to your closest competitors?</li>
<li>In terms of configuration - have you looked at internal processes and structures before or have you focused only on external facing innovations?</li>
<li>In terms of Offering and Experience - what do you know about what your customers need? Are your innovations tuned to customer needs?</li>
<li>Have you gone through the tactics? Can you identify those you have been practicing? Is there anything missing that you want to make a note of? </li>
<li>Which tactics have you considered earlier and chosen not to go forward with? Which tactics are new to you? What do you potentially want to try out?</li>
<li>Does your organization need incremental or transformational innovation?</li>
