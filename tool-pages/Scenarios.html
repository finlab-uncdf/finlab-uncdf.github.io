						<p>Scenarios are short stories (usually visual) used to convey the purpose of a service that has yet to exist and collect first impressions or feedback from potential users.</p>

						<h2>USE CASES</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Collect initial reactions or concerns from users</li>

					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>
						
						<p>Scenarios should be clear and visual - they might require professional illustrations to produce.</p>

					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>A scenario is either an end-to-end representation of a service journey, or a focused view of one part of the journey. Scenarios can be used to receive feedback from respondents on a current journey, evaluate different versions of a current journey, or imagine new journeys.</li>
<li>Scenarios that capture critical milestones and touch-points can often be sufficient. Over detailing can get the respondent caught up in details.</li>
<li>Text and visuals are both used to build scenarios - so that there is minimal loss in translation. Headline text to describe the overall scenario, and descriptive text explaining a milestone can be used.</li>
<li>Visuals on a scenario should be as contextualised and localised as much as possible. Icons and sketches that are alien can confuse respondents.</li>
<li>In any session 3-4 scenarios may be enough to place before a respondent.</li>
<li>Scenarios are often used as a part of User Interviews - they are what researchers call 'probes'. They help researchers touch upon aspects of experience and need that an oral conversation may not be able to cover.</li>
<li>Respondents should be asked to comment on each scenario, and then summarise their feedback once at the end. As respondents study scenarios, researchers should be prepared to answer any questions that come up.</li>
</ul>

							<h2>STEP BY STEP</h2>

						<ol>
<li><span>Brainstorm concepts:</span> Organise a brainstorming session to come up with ideas you'd like to get feedback on.</li>
<li><span>Prepare the scenario cards:</span> On A4 size sheets of paper, put into words what the service does and briefly mention how. Only a couple sentences are necessary. Once the script is ready, create simple visuals for the scenarios.</li>
<li><span>Present to users:</span> Present the scenarios to respondents, and see what they understand at first. Then explain to them the concept, and have them give feedback on each scenario.</li>
<li><span>Collect feedback:</span> Once the scenarios have been presented, have the respondents share their feedback by asking them what they think of the concept.</li>

					<h2><span>HOW TO</span> FOR FACILITATORS</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> See if the team is clear on which scenarios they wish to place before respondents and why. If they aren't - help them brainstorm.</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Help teams develop their ideas into short scripts that will be the basis of the scenario. Ask them to identify headline and body text where required.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants test together how they plan on using the tool during the research session.</li>
</ol>

					<h2>FACILITATORS QUESTION BANK</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>What part of the service or system do you want to test as scenarios?</li>
<li>What are the different scenarios you plan on using? Why did you choose these particular scenarios?</li>
<li>Do you have your scenario scripts in place?</li>
<li>Who is going to visualise the scenarios? Are the visuals are easily understood?</li>
<li>What kind of headline and descriptive text are you using?</li>
<li>How will you introduce the exercise to respondents?</li>
<li>What specific parts of the scenario do you want respondents to focus on?</li>
<li>Do you have a list of follow up questions and prompts ready?</li>
