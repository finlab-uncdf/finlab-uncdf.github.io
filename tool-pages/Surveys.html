						<p>Surveys are a form of research which are used to quickly document inputs from large samples of users. Surveys help build an early estimate of quantitative trends relevant to the research enquiries.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>USE CASES</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Build a broad sense of usersâ€™ perceptions and needs.</li>
<li>Collect data from a large sample of respondents in a short time.</li>
<li>Estimate the scale or size of opinion and need.</li>
<li>Screen potential respondents for interviews and FGDs.</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>
						
						<p>While great to quickly capture multiple inputs, Surveys lack the depth of in-depth interviews. Researchers tend to bring their bias into survey design by asking leading questions.</p>

					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>A survey is a questionnaire with respondents choosing answers from a predetermined set of responses (multiple choice). Surveys are not open ended conversations like user interviews.</li>
<li>A survey typically collects some basic demographic and contact information from respondents at the start or end.</li>
<li>A survey is typically conducted with a much larger base of respondents than user interviews. If 10-15 respondents are being interviewed, a survey can look to target 100 or more respondents.</li>
<li>Questions in a survey are not meant to be open ended as those in an interview. While interviews have the benefit of researchers being able to probe and ask follow up questions, surveys are one way responses, from respondent to researcher.</li>
<li>Surveys can be easily drafted on online survey tools (for example - Survey Monkey, Typeform, Google Forms, etc.). Online tools make it easy to manage responses. Surveys can also be administered physically (paper forms).</li>
<li>Unlike user interviews where the focus is on deep insight, surveys are useful to address basic quantitative questions (for example, market size, preference level, etc.).</li>

							<h2>STEP BY STEP</h2>

						<ol>
<li><span>Review lines of enquiry:</span> List all the key lines of enquiry you wish to gain more clarity on through the survey.</li>
<li><span>Define questions:</span> Once ready, translate the lines of enquiry into clear and concise questions. Avoid leading or biased language.</li>
<li><span>Disseminate the surveys:</span> Online surveys can be disseminated via email, social media channels, chat, etc. Surveys can also be conducted in person by meeting users.</li>
<li><span>Review responses:</span> Review results as a team and look for patterns in the responses.</li>

					<h2><span>HOW TO</span> FOR FACILITATORS</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Explain the activity to the participants, make sure a survey is relevant to their needs.</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Help the participants frame questions, and identify who they will be surveying.</li>
<li><span>At the close:</span> Have participants discuss their questions, and if they have administered the survey, then share some key data points and learnings.</li>

					<h2>FACILITATORS QUESTION BANK</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>What is the goal of doing a survey?</li>
<li>Are you going to be doing interviews and a survey? How many respondents are you looking for, in each activity?</li>
<li>How will the focus of the survey differ from the interviews and group discussions?</li>
<li>Who will you be surveying? How will you reach them?</li>
<li>Have you reviewed your questions, are they leading or biased in any way?</li>
<li>How will you analyse the data?</li>
