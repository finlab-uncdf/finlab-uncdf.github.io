					<div class="tool-about">
						
						<p>The ‘What If’ tool helps participants come up with new ideas by prodding them to think along a few key directions. In a sense, the tool is a solution oriented version of the POEMS tool that is used for observation. The tool focuses on how solutions can be realised through diverse manifestations.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>USE CASES</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Identify ideas that cover a healthy range of possibilities.</li>
<li>Make ideation a focused yet enjoyable exercise.</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>
						
						<p>The 'What If' tool is useful as a tool to kick start ideation. But, it allows for only limited kinds of ideas to emerge. Teams should ideally follow up the use of 'What If' with other tools that ensure they are covering multiple directions. </p>

					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>‘<span>Physical Object or a Thing</span>’ is where solutions that take the form of a physical object or product or space, are to be parked.</li>
<li>‘<span>Service or Process</span>’ is to note down solutions take the form of services or systems that the user can interact with.</li>
<li>‘<span>A Person or a Set of People</span>’ is to capture solutions where real people are involved - there may be some overlap with 'Services' here.</li>
<li>‘<span>A Digital Interaction</span>’ is to capture ideas in which the solution takes the form of a website or application that the user interacts with.</li>
<li>‘<span>A Piece of Communication</span>’ is to make note of any messaging or communication material that forms part of the solution.</li>

						<ol>
<li><span>Choose a Challenge:</span> Review the design challenges and focus on one to take into ideation. Keep the Persona, Insights, and Key Takeaways handy.</li>
<li><span>Brainstorm:</span> Think of as many ideas as possible - individually and as a group. Write ideas down on sticky notes and park them in relevant columns.</li>
<li><span>Discuss:</span> Discuss ideas that seem common or frequent. Discuss any that seem  unique and interesting. Discuss any ideas that touch upon more than one type.</li>

					<h2><span>HOW TO</span> FOR FACILITATORS</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure participants understand the flow of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Get the participants to think through each type of solution. Encourage brainstorming that is bold, practical and playful.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants take you through their ideas, and discuss any interesting patterns that may be emerging.</li>
</ol>

				<div class="f-question-bank">
					<h2>FACILITATORS QUESTION BANK</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Can you think of at least one solution under each of the different forms and manifestations?</li>
<li>Do you want to start individually first, and then discuss as a group?</li>
<li>Are there any other forms that you can think of that aren't listed in the template?</li>
<li>Is there anything interesting you can take away from these ideas? Are there any patterns emerging?</li>
<li>Are there ideas that can take more than one form?</li>
<li>Are there ideas that are a combination of two or more forms?</li>
