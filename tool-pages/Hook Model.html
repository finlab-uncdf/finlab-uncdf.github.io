					<div class="tool-about">
						
						<p>The Hook Model is a tool used to encourage habitual use of products, services and systems by users. For a business, habit forming products are more efficient, create predictability, and generate greater user lifetime value among other benefits. The HOOK model applies itself to both first time users, and those who may have used a product or service before. The model focuses on identifying  ways to make the user experience simpler, more engaging, and more rewarding so that users keep returning and using a product or service. </p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>USE CASES</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Identify a strategy to encourage users to come back to a product or service after they have used it for the first time.</li>
<li>Identify a strategy to encourage users to keep using  a product or service over time. </li>
<li>Identify a strategy to encourage habits and repeated behaviour in any context. </li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>
						
						<p>The HOOK model was developed based on learnings of user behaviour on online platforms and social networking sites. It therefore may seem sometimes come across as a limited framework in cases where technology may not be involved.</p>

					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>There are four major components of the HOOK Model - ‘<span>Triggers</span>’, ‘<span>Action</span>’, ‘<span>Rewards</span>’ and ‘<span>Investment</span>’.</li>
<li>‘<span>Triggers</span>’: Things that prompt or influence users to interact with a product/service. A designer can choose to focus on an influence strategy that keeps users coming back. There are two types -   1) Internal Triggers are the fundamental emotions and thoughts  (such as boredom, confusion, loneliness) or  routines (such as reading newspapers, budgeting, seeking a deal) that users are trying to address - understanding and addressing them can keep users engaged. 2)  External Triggers: Triggers that are focused on marketing and advertising vehicles that bring users on board. There are four types of external triggers - A) Paid Triggers: Advertising, search engine marketing, and other paid channels are commonly used to get users</span>’ attention and prompt them to act.  B) Earned Triggers: Things like public and media relations, press mentions, viral videos, and features that are not necessarily paid for.  C) Relationship Triggers: Word of mouth or recommendations. D) Owned Triggers: Triggers that can  be used once a signup or some user intent has been shown  - app icons, notifications, newsletters etc.</li>
<li>‘<span>Action</span>’: Things that impact the ease of use of a product/service. A designer can minimise users</span>’ effort so that they keep coming back. There are six elements to minimising effort - 1) Time: Reduce the amount of time it takes to start using. 2) Money: Reduce the monetary cost for user. 3) Physical effort: Reduce the amount of labour involved in use. 4) Brain cycles: Reduce the level of mental effort and focus required to use. 5) Social deviance: Increase the level of acceptance use  has from the user</span>’s community and influencers. 6) Non-routine: Reduce the level to which the use disrupts existing routines. </li>
<li>‘<span>Variable Rewards</span>’: Things that provide an incentive for users to use. Designers can create an incentive or reward structure that engages users and is exciting (variations, unpredictability etc.). There are three fundamental types of rewards that a product/service can offer - 1) Reward of the Tribe: Rewards that focus on social/community participation and recognition  for user. 2) Reward of the Hunt: Rewards that focus on material and information benefit for users. 3) Reward of the Self: Rewards that focus on  self development and personal growth for users. </li>
<li>‘<span>Investment</span>’: Things that get users to invest their time and effort, and therefore associate  value with use. Designers can encourage users to make personal investment in the product or service.  There are five main ways in which users can become invested - 1) Content: Users will stay if they create and store content that they value. 2) Data: Users will stay if they share and link information (like KYC) that gets them to stay with a product or service. 3)  Network: Users will stay if they become a part of a community - as a follower, a friend, as someone with followers - so as to create a personal  bond. 4) Reputation: Users will stay if they have a personal reputation within the community that they value. 5) Skill: Users will stay if they develop a skill or competency that they value.</li>

							<h2>STEP BY STEP</h2>
						</div>
						
						<ol>
<li><span>Familiarise yourself:</span> Read through the various boxes of the HOOK Model and consider how these may apply to the current or proposed product/ service solution.</li>
<li><span>First Time/New User:</span> You may begin by thinking of how a first time or new user is being taken through the steps. Start  by mapping the current journey and then identify gaps.</li>
<li><span>Existing Users:</span> Next, you may think of an existing user or a repeat user who can potentially stay with the product or service for a long time. You can begin by mapping current journey and then identify gaps. </li>
<li><span>Brainstorm & Discuss:</span> Based on the gaps identified for new and current users, you may next identify potential solutions to try out. You may also use the tool with different kinds of user personas.</li>

					<h2><span>HOW TO</span> FOR FACILITATORS</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Start with a discussion focused on why habit forming products and services are important. Walk them through the tool, and then move along the cycle from triggers to investment. Teams can be asked to map what they do currently, identify gaps and think of new ways they can look at the steps. </li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants walk you through the worksheet they have filled out and probe them on their mapping of the current and their ideas for things they can try out.</li>
</ol>

				<div class="f-question-bank">
					<h2>FACILITATORS QUESTION BANK</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Why is creating a habit around your product or service important? </li>
<li>What is the fundamental need you are solving for? Is that important enough to be an internal trigger?</li>
<li>How are you thinking of creating stickiness for a new / first time user? How are you thinking of creating stickiness for an existing user?</li>
<li>What kind of triggers have you considered currently? What have you not considered? How have you used external triggers? How can you improve them? </li>
<li>How easy is it for first time and existing users to use your product or service? What can be eased based on your understanding of what their needs are? Are there examples that you can learn from?</li>
<li>How are users being rewarded? Is the reward evident? Is there variability and unpredictability? Are you considering the three types of rewards? Any examples you can borrow from? </li>
<li>How are you ensuring that users stay invested in your product/service? What kind of investments do you want them to make? Will asking users to invest impact ease and trust negatively? </li>
<li>Are you encouraging useful, positive habits for your users or are you thinking only from your own perspective? </li>
