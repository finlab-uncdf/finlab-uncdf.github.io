						<h2>About</h2>
						
						<p>Roadmapping is an important step of clarifying the direction of a startup or programme over the next few years. It helps the team align on which challenges to prioritise and the ideal path moving forward.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>Use Cases</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Building consensus on the company or programme's strategic direction. </li>
<li>Identifying key milestones and responsibilities of each team. </li>
<li>Formulating an actionable plan for the team to work towards.</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>Limitations</h2>
						
						<p>Created for and by the Startup community this format may feel a little tedious, participants should feel comfortable adapting the template to their needs.</p>

					<h2>Understand</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>The ‘<span>Team</span>’ column refers to any team involved in the process of developing each phase and clearly identifying key roles and responsibilities. Teams can include marketing, developers, strategy or any other arm of the practice involved in the development of the product or the program. </li>
<li>‘<span>POC</span>’ or Proof Of Concept is the first tangible version of the concept. It should validate assumptions regarding the functionality and desirability of the product without necessarily having resolved all the technical issues with it.</li>
<li>‘<span>MVP</span>’ short for Minimum Viable Product, refers to the earliest version of a digital product, it is a streamlined version of the service or product (only contains key, necessary features) used to understand where the core of the business opportunity lies.  </li>
<li>‘<span>Alpha</span>’ is the first release with actual users in a controlled environment like a Focus Group Discussion (FGD). This allows for feedback from real users without having to resolve all the bugs or technical challenges behind the product or service.</li>
<li>‘<span>Beta</span>’ is the first public release used to gather feedback from a wide array of users.</li>
<li>‘<span>Launch</span>’ milestones should cover any final challenges regarding going to market like landing strategic partnerships or additional features to be integrated based on feedback on previous iterations.</li>
<li>'success Metrics</span>’ should be defined based on the goals and milestones set for each phase of development, these are metrics used to validate assumptions and to make a case for continuing the development of the project all along the way.</li>

<li><span>Familiarise yourself:</span> Review the Startup Canvas, you'll notice the left two columns have to do with internal activity and the two to the right refer to external forces.</li>
<li><span>Get started:</span> As a business, what do you have most clarity on? Is it your customer segment or your understanding of the problem? Use these questions to decide which side of the canvas to start on.</li>
<li><span>Complete:</span> Go through each box and fill out as much as you can. It is completely fine not to know the answer to specific areas.</li>
<li><span>Identify Knowledge Gaps:</span> Once the worksheet is completed to the best your knowledge, jot down in a different color remaining knowledge gaps. Do you have clear revenue streams? Do you have strong metrics to track your progress?</li>

<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Help participants understand where they stand on the roadmap and if any edits should be made to the template. </li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Make sure clear milestones have been formulated, and encourage participants to get input from representatives of the teams listed in the roadmap that may not have been available for the activity. </li>

<li>Are you familiar with this format? Do you have your own version in your organisation?</li>
<li>How far are you currently on this roadmap? Should anything on here be changed?</li>
<li>Who / What are your core team in your organisation? Let's list them in the left column.</li>
<li>What kind milestones have you been using so far? Were those clearly communicated to the respective teams? How well did they work?</li>
<li>Regarding the metrics, do you currently have performance metric in your organisation? Would those be relevant to these milestones or should we create new ones?</li>
