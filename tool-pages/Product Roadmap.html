						<h2>About</h2>
						
						<p>Roadmapping is an important step of clarifying the direction of a startup or programme over the next few years. It helps the team align on which challenges to prioritise and the ideal path moving forward.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>Use Cases</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Build consensus on a company's or programme's strategic direction. </li>
<li>Identify key milestones and responsibilities of each team. </li>
<li>Formulate an actionable plan for the team to work towards.</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>Limitations</h2>
						
						<p>Created for and by the Startup community this format may feel a little tedious - given that pivots and iterations are a reality. Participants should feel free to adapt the template in a way that best reflects their approach and needs.</p>

					<h2>Understand</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>The ‘<span>Team</span>’ column aims to identify teams involved in different phase, and clearly identifying key roles and responsibilities. Teams can include marketing, developers, strategy or any other arm of the practice involved in development. </li>
<li>‘<span>POC</span>’ or Proof Of Concept is the first tangible version of the concept. It should validate assumptions regarding the functionality and desirability of the product without necessarily having resolved all the technical issues with it.</li>
<li>‘<span>MVP</span>’ short for Minimum Viable Product, refers to the earliest streamlined version of a service or product (only contains key, necessary features) used to understand where the core of the business opportunity lies and if customers respond favourably. </li>
<li>‘<span>Alpha</span>’ is the first release with a set of actual users in a controlled, experimental environment. This allows for feedback from real users without having to resolve all the bugs and technical challenges.</li>
<li>‘<span>Beta</span>’ is the first public release used to gather feedback from a wide array of users.</li>
<li>‘<span>Launch</span>’ milestones should cover any final challenges regarding going to market like landing strategic partnerships or additional features to be integrated based on feedback on previous iterations.</li>
<li>‘<span>Success Metrics</span>’ should be defined based on the goals and milestones set for each phase of development. These metrics are used to validate assumptions and to guide progress.</li>

							<h2>Step by Step</h2>

<li><span>Familiarise yourself with the phases:</span> Review the various phases of development and make sure they make sense to everyone (POC, MVP, Alpha, Beta).</li>
<li><span>Identify teams:</span> In the left-most column identify the teams and skill necessary at each level of development, some phases may require more marketing where other phases require developers.</li>
<li><span>Map deliverables:</span> Go through each phase and prioritise features and other deliverables linked to each team. The result of the exercise should be discussed and challenged to ensure it is feasible and strategically sound.</li>
<li><span>Digitise and share:</span> After completion, digitise the document and share it with your teams.</li>

<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Help participants understand where they stand on the roadmap and if any edits should be made to the template. </li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Make sure clear milestones have been formulated, and encourage participants to get input from representatives of the teams listed in the roadmap that may not have been available for the activity. </li>

<li>Are you familiar with this format? Do you have your own version in your organisation?</li>
<li>What kind of visibility do you have into what the next 3-6-12 months look like?</li>
<li>How far are you currently on this roadmap? Should anything here be changed to reflect your own approach?</li>
<li>Who is part of the core team in your organisation? Let's list them in the left column.</li>
<li>What kind of milestones have you been using so far? Were those clearly communicated to the respective teams? How well did they work?</li>
<li>Do you currently have performance metric guiding development in your organisation? Are those tied to the milestones?</li>
