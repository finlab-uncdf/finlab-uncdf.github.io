					<div class="tool-about">
						
						<p>A ‘Design Challenge’ provides necessary direction and constraints for meaningful solutions to emerge. Framed in the form of 'How Might We..?' statements, Design Challenges help problem solvers think from a solution oriented mindset. The quality of challenge statements framed reflects a team's understanding of problems and opportunities that are worth solving. </p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>USE CASES</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Translate a complex problem or opportunity into a clear solution oriented brief for solutioning</li>
<li>Define constraints for brainstorming</li>
<li>Enable brainstorming to focus on the user</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>
						
						<p>It is crucial that 'Design Challenges' reflect the insights and learnings from research. Challenges that fail to do so risk derailing the solutioning process. Also, it is important that innovators list multiple challenges statements before choosing a final set that seems focused and exciting. </p>

					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>The ‘<span>Solution Goal</span>’ captures the intended impact of the solution and who it will benefit - for example, enhance experience by making interactions simpler for users who are not experts in technology use.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Opportunity</span>’ statements convey possible strategies to meet the Solution Goal using How Might We (HMW) statements. To frame HMW statements, a team should look back at insights that point to actions that could help achieve the goal - for example, HMW onboard users to enhance the experience for users who may not be experts? or HMW provide voice based guidance to users as a way to enhance their use experience?</li>
<li>The final ‘<span>Design Challenge</span>’ is a HMW statement that the team selects to brainstorm for.</li>

					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure everyone understands the various terms in the template.</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Help the participants draw from their previous insights and learnings to frame the Solution Goal and HMW statements.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have teams walk you through their goals and challenge statements. Discuss the kind of HMW statements framed, and how teams might have chosen their final challenges.</li>

					<h2>FACILITATORS QUESTION BANK</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Does the team have a clear idea of what they are trying to achieve?</li>
<li>What problem are you solving for and for whom?</li>
<li>What HMWs are you gravitating towards? Why?</li>
<li>Do any other HMWs come to mind?</li>
<li>Are the HMWs actionable? Should they be made more specific or perhaps be broader?</li>
<li>Which HMW do you feel is the strongest?</li>
<li>How well does this statement align with your Design Principles?</li>
