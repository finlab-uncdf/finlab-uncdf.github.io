					<div class="tool-about">
						
						<p>A ‘Design Challenge’ provides necessary direction and constraints for meaningful solutions to emerge. Framed in the form of 'How Might We..?' statements, Design Challenges help problem solvers think from a solution oriented mindset. The quality of challenge statements reflects a team's understanding of problems and opportunities that are worth solving. </p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>USE CASES</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Translate a complex problem or opportunity into a clear solution oriented brief for solutioning</li>
<li>Define constraints for brainstorming</li>
<li>Enable brainstorming to focus on the user </li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>
						
						<p>It is crucial that 'Design Challenges' reflect the insights and learnings from research. Challenges that fail to do so risk derailing the solutioning process. Also, it is important that innovators list multiple challenges statements before choosing a final set that seem focused and exciting. </p>

					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Defining a Design Challenge is an organic process that can be hard to formalise. It is recommended to clearly visualise the thought process even if it may feel a little redundant. </li>
<li>The ‘<span>Solution Goal</span>’ should capture the intended impact and who it will benefit. To be relevant, any solution brainstormed beyond this point should directly address the Solution Goal statement.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Opportunity</span>’ statements will convey possible strategies to leverage in order to meet the Solution Goal using How Might We statements. Some HMWs may have already been created in a previous session, if so those should be taken into account as well.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Design Challenge</span>’ should be a prioritised Opportunity statement that the team wishes to solution for over the remainder of the exercise.</li>
</ul>

							<h2>STEP BY STEP</h2>
						</div>
						
						<ol>
<li><span>Define the Solution Goal:</span> Before to define the challenges, articulate the overall goal that you are solutioning for - call out who the solution involves and what is that you are trying to achieve - for example, enhance experience by making interactions simpler for users who are not experts in technology use. </li>
<li><span>Define Challenges:</span> Translate the Solution Goal into a series of possible challenge statements/opportunities. Look back at the insights to inform what key actions could help achieve the goal - for example, how might we onboard users to enhance the experience for users who may not be experts?</li>
<li><span>Prioritise Challenge:</span> Build consensus on a relevant and exciting Design Challenge that the team wants to move forward with.</li>

					<h2><span>HOW TO</span> FOR FACILITATORS</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure everyone understands the various terms in the template.</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Help the participants draw from their previous discussions, this should be an opportunity to reflect on and synthesise existing work rather than finding new ideas.</li>

					<h2>FACILITATORS QUESTION BANK</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Does the team have a clear idea of what they are trying to achieve? </li>
<li>What problem are you solving for and for whom?</li>
<li>What HMWs are you gravitating towards? Why?</li>
<li>Do any other HMWs come to mind?</li>
<li>Are these HMWs actionable? Should they be made more specific or more broad?</li>
<li>Which HMW do you feel is the strongest?</li>
<li>How well does this statement align with your Design Principles?</li>
