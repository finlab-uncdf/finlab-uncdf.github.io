					<div class="tool-about">
						
						<p>Wireframing is a form of prototyping that is used specifically for the design of digital products and services. Wireframes are representative visualisations of web or app screens that users will come across at various points of their journey.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>USE CASES</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Prototype and test digital product and service experiences.</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>
						
						<p>Wireframing has limited ability to communicate the full complexity of a product or service - the focus is primarily on digital interactions. Wireframes are also basic visualisations, that do not offer the full experience that well designed screens may create - while testing, it's important for designers to keep that in mind as they receive feedback.</p>

					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Wireframes are basic visualisations - boxes and texts are used to represent eventual digital screens.</li>
<li>It is rare for designers to build wireframes for each and every step of a service journey - the focus is usually on key screens and interactions. Alternatively, detailed wireframes are often built for one part of the journey - for example, onboarding screens, learning section, profile pages etc.</li>
<li>Typically, phone outlines are used to communicate that the screens are meant for an app. Similarly for web screens - a laptop outline can be used.</li>
<li>Screens are connected by drawing lines between them. Lines represent how screens are intended to flow from one to another.</li>
<li>Versions of screens can be drawn to represent a service journey in different ways - this is useful for more thorough user testing.</li>
<li>Wireframes are tested with users in the form of paper prints or as interactive prototypes (where buttons actually work). An interactive digital prototype can be created by using basic software like PowerPoint, or professional design software like Zeplin or Invision.</li>
<li>While testing, as users go over screens - aided (where designers explain each screen) or unaided (no explanations given) - designers need to keep a note of feedback - positive and negative.</li>
</ul>

							<h2>STEP BY STEP</h2>

						<ol>
<li><span>Outline the key steps:</span> Start by discussing as a team the key stages, user actions and interactions along the experience journey. Refer to the Journey Map tool if the team has already developed one.</li>
<li><span>Visualise the touchpoints:</span> For each step in the service journey, identify the screens necessary to bring the concept to life and draw them out one after the other. Design different versions of the wireframes if the intent is to do A/B testing.</li>
<li><span>Connect the screens:</span> Connection the different screens by linking how a button may lead from one screen to another.</li>
<li><span>Test & Refine:</span> Test wireframes with different users, and record points of improvement.</li>

					<h2><span>HOW TO</span> FOR FACILITATORS</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure the team has a clear understanding of the key steps of their service.</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Help teams Prioritise screens to prototype. Help them create clear wireframes, while not wasting time on adding unnecessary detail. Ensure teams think about screen flows and connections.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants present the wireframes to another group and refine their screens based on the feedback. If they are taking wireframes to users for testing, help them prepare for the test. Once the testing is over, discuss learnings and refinement.</li>
</ol>

					<h2>FACILITATORS QUESTION BANK</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Are you going to building wireframes for the entire journey? Or a select part of the journey?</li>
<li>Are you building screens for an application or for a website?</li>
<li>Are the wireframes simple enough to understand? Do you want to add descriptions under each screen?</li>
<li>How are the screens you have created connected to each other?</li>
<li>How do you plan to test the screens? Who will you test them with?</li>
