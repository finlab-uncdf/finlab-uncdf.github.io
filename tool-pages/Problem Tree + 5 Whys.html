					<div class="tool-about">
						
						<p>Problem Tree is a tool used to identify effects and causes of a given challenge. The aim is to repeatedly unpack each symptom until one reaches a “root cause” or unexpected angle from which to think of the problem. It provides a visual breakdown of problems into their symptoms as well as their causes. While traditionally the tool is looked only through a problem lens, it can also use it to appreciate opportunities. 5 Whys are an activity that can be run during the Problem Tree to help participants get to the root cause of the topic.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>USE CASES</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Unpack a problem or topic further understanding in the group.</li>
<li>Uncover unexpected opportunities and challenges.</li>
<li>Identify interdependencies amongst opportunities and challenges.</li>
<li>Identify potential root causes for challenges. </li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>
						
						<p>The Problem Tree does not give any indication of the magnitude or the importance of the causes of the problem or opportunity area. It may also be difficult to understand the effects and causes right from the beginning and may require a few iterations and more data from implementation.</p>

					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>The ‘<span>Problem/Opportunity</span>’ should be something specific that needs to be investigated. This could be the problem faced by the user, or an opportunity area defined by a team or organisation.</li>
<li>‘<span>Effects</span>’ are the visible or invisible results of the problem. These should be mapped on the branches of the tree - for example, if the problem is defined as ‘<span>Poor Public Transport</span>’, then an effect would probably be, ‘<span>Commuter getting late to work</span>’, or ‘<span>Expensive private transport options</span>’.</li>
<li>‘<span>Causes</span>’ are underlying reasons behind the problem or opportunity. They are mapped on the roots of the tree - for example, the root cause of ‘<span>Poor Public Transport</span>’ could probably be, ‘<span>Inadequate public funding</span>’ or ‘<span>Poor route planning</span>’.</li>
<li>The levels to which ‘<span>Effects</span>’ and ‘<span>Causes</span>’ can be unpacked depend on the understanding the team has of the topic at hand. </li>

							<h2>STEP BY STEP</h2>
						</div>
						
						<ol>
<li><span>State the problem:</span> Start by drawing a tree trunk, label it with the main problem or opportunity that you are looking to tackle.</li>
<li><span>List the effects:</span> Start by listing visible effects of the problem at hand and then try to identify more indirect impacts of the problem.</li>
<li><span>List the causes:</span> List potential causes for the given problem or opportunity. List all potential causes the team can think of - keep creating branches.</li>
<li><span>Dig deeper:</span> To really get into the depth (or root cause) - use the '5 Whys' - until you feel that you have a strong enough root cause.</li>

					<h2><span>HOW TO</span> FOR FACILITATORS</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Explain the activity to the participants, preferably using examples. Make sure they first write down the effects and then the causes.</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Ensure that the participants don‘t get stuck or fixate on a single train of thought.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants share their root causes and talk through their process.</li>
</ol>
				</div>
				
				<div class="f-question-bank">
					<h2>FACILITATORS QUESTION BANK</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>What are the most immediate causes and effects you can think of as a group?</li>
<li>Have we gone deep enough? Can we unpack this effect / cause further?</li>
<li>Why does the 'effects' happen? Can we list those reasons as well as sub effects?</li>
<li>What root causes have we identified? Are any of those surprising or unexpected?</li>
<li>Since we have to use this as an input for planning research in the next phase, what are some themes (to be taken from effects or causes) that you feel we need to focus on during research?</li>
<li>How should we prioritise between causes? Which ones do you think are the most important? Is there a cause that we are all excited about trying to solve? </li>
