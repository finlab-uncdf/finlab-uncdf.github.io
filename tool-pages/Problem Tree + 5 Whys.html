						<p>Problem Tree is a tool used to map effects and causes relevant to a problem. While traditionally the tool has been looked at through a problem lens, it can also be used to map opportunities, and trends. It is used in the planning stages to explore lines of enquiry and priorities. 5 Whys is a tool that is often used as part of the Problem Tree activity, it helps teams get to root causes.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>USE CASES</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Unpack a problem or topic to build understanding in a group.</li>
<li>Identify potential root causes for challenges and opportunities.</li>
<li>Uncover unexplored opportunities and challenges.</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>
						
						<p>Teams may struggle to map all effects and causes early in the process, without the benefit of research and reflection.</p>

					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>The ‘<span>Problem/Opportunity</span>’ should be something specific that needs to be investigated. This could be a problem faced by the user, or an opportunity area defined by a team or organisation.</li>
<li>‘<span>Effects</span>’ are the visible and invisible impacts of the problem. They are mapped on the branches of the tree. For example, if the problem is defined as ‘<span>Poor Public Transport</span>’, then an effect would be - commuters getting late to work, stress in the city, chaos in certain times of the day.</li>
<li>‘<span>Causes</span>’ are underlying reasons behind the problem or opportunity. They are mapped on the roots of the tree. For example, the root cause of ‘<span>Poor Public Transport</span>’ could probably be, inadequate public funding</span>’ or poor route planning.</li>
<li>The levels to which ‘<span>Effects</span>’ and ‘<span>Causes</span>’ can be unpacked depend on, the understanding the team has of the topic at hand.</li>
</ul>

							<h2>STEP BY STEP</h2>
						</div>
						
						<ol>
<li><span>State the problem:</span> Start by drawing a tree trunk, label it with the main problem or opportunity that you are looking to tackle.</li>
<li><span>List the effects:</span> Start by listing visible effects of the problem, and then identify indirect impacts of the problem.</li>
<li><span>List the causes:</span> List potential causes for the given problem or opportunity.</li>
<li><span>Dig deeper:</span> To really get into the depth (or root cause), ask the '5 Whys'. Ask first why something is a cause, and keep asking why (derived from the preceding answer) till you have a strong, relevant root cause.</li>

					<h2><span>HOW TO</span> FOR FACILITATORS</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Using examples, explain the activity to participants. Make sure they first write down the effects and then the causes.</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Ensure that the participants don‘t get stuck or fixate on a single train of thought.</li>
<li><span>At the close:</span> Have participants share their root causes and talk through their process.</li>
</ol>
				</div>
				
				<div class="f-question-bank">
					<h2>FACILITATORS QUESTION BANK</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>What are the most immediate causes and effects you can think of as a group?</li>
<li>Have we gone deep enough? Can we unpack this effect / cause further?</li>
<li>Why do the 'effects' happen? Can we list those reasons as well as sub effects?</li>
<li>What root causes have we identified? Are any of those surprising or unexpected?</li>
<li>Since we have to use this as an input for planning research in the next phase, what are some themes (to be taken from effects or causes) that you feel we need to focus on during research?</li>
<li>How should we prioritise between causes? Which ones do you think are the most important? Is there a cause that we are all excited about trying to solve?</li>
