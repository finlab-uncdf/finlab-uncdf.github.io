						<p>Timeline is an activity used to understand the evolution of a topic/subject over a period of time. It helps researchers map historical or future trends, and question underlying user attitudes and experiences. </p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>USE CASES</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Mapping the past evolution of a product, service, system, technology, program etc. or the expected evolution in the future.  </li>
<li>Mapping the past evolution of an organisation, an industry/sector, competitive landscape etc., or the expected evolution in the future. </li>
<li>Mapping the past evolution of an idea, theory, norm, belief, culture etc., or the expected evolution in the future.</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>LIMTATIONS</h2>
						
						<p>The timeline tool depends a lot on the research participant's own recollection and understanding of phases, events and trends. It is upto the researcher to ask follow up questions (5 Whys is a good tool) and get to meaningful learnings. </p>

					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>‘<span>Periods</span>’ are the distinct time periods that the researcher is trying to map. This could be in terms of decades/months/weeks (for example - 1990s, 2000s, 2010s) or even life stages (for example - childhood/teenage/youth). The choice of time frames is flexible and to be decided by the researcher. </li>
<li> ‘<span>What?</span>’ is the section in which participants</span>’ inputs on objects/events/actions/behaviours/beliefs that best fit into a particular time period are noted down (for example - music in the 90s was about the Sony Walkman, in the 2000s it was about the iPod, in 2010s all music was on smartphones).</li>
<li>‘<span>Where?</span>’ is the section in which the input from the participant is focused on description of location - physical spaces/ geographies/sectors/internet that can add some further context to the ‘<span>What?</span>’ section (for example - music in the 90s was about the local music store and music at cafes, in 2000s about iTunes and pirated MP3 collections, and in the 2010s about streaming platforms like Spotify). </li>
<li>‘<span>Who?</span>’ goes a step further by focusing on the individuals/groups/communities/cultures/entities that the participant most closely associated with the timeline (for example - music choice in the 90s was most influenced by MTV, in the 2000s by friends, in the 2010s by recommendations by the platform itself, and all through by what is played on radio).</li>
<li>Researchers should be prepared to ask follow up questions as participants describe a time period. Some questions to consider - Why was something the way it was? How did you feel at the time? What did you like or dislike? Do you have specific memories that you can share? How would you summarise the period? Do you like the way its progressed so far? What do you miss most about an earlier period? </li>
</ul>

							<h2>STEP BY STEP</h2>

						<ol>
<li><span>Choose a research focus:</span> Start by defining the topic being mapped and relevant periodic increments (months, years, decades?).</li>
<li><span>Find Details:</span> Ask the research participant to think of more details from every periodic increment, by asking them to recall media such as videos, games, news, etc.</li>
<li><span>Follow Up Questions:</span> Try asking follow up questions, it could help get more details and information about a particular time period–such as Why, How, What?</li>
<li><span>Continue the conversation:</span> Feel free to have a conversation with your participant in order to elicit more details. You can categorise the information later.</li>

					<h2><span>HOW TO</span> FOR FACILITATORS</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck). </li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Start with participants’ existing knowledge of their activity to create a first version of the tool. Help them frame questions for their discussions with the participants.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants explain the map period by period, elucidating on the details of each time period.</li>
