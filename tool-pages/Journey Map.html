						<p>Journey Map is a tool used at various points in the research, design, and prototyping steps of the design process. It is used to document the different stages, touchpoints, interactions and emotions a respondent goes through as part of the end-to-end experience. It helps designers view experiences as holistic offerings rather than as a sum of silos. While journeys might differ for different kinds of users, and for different use cases - journey maps can be used to document all types of relevant journeys.  </p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>USE CASES</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Map products, services and systems as end-to-end user experience journeys.</li>
<li>Document current experiences for users.</li>
<li>Reveal opportunities for improving experience at each step.</li>
<li>Reimagine future experiences for users.</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>
						
						<p>The use of the ‘Journey Map’ tool is dependent on the designer's ability to accurately map all steps of an end-to-end experience, and focus on the details. </p>

					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>The ‘<span>Timeline</span>’ is the section meant to note what part of the journey is being mapped - is it end-to-end or a part of the experience?</li>
<li>The ‘<span>What do users do?</span>’ section should be a description of key stages/steps that users go through, and a documentation of their key actions at each step.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>What do users like/not like</span>’ sections should describe the positive and negative aspects of the user's experience at each step of the journey.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Opportunities</span>’ section is where teams can start mapping ideas to either elevate positive experience, or address negative experience.</li>
</ul>

							<h2>STEP BY STEP</h2>
						</div>
						
						<ol>
<li><span>Define the scope:</span> Journey Maps can be used to document end-to-end journeys, or a part of a journey. They can be mapped for different users and use cases. Decide what fits in scope for the task at hand.</li>
<li><span>Map the experience:</span> Go through each step of the journey and map interactions and touchpoints that are key to the experience. Next, based on the information gathered from users, map positive and negative experiences through the course of the journey. If thinking of a new journey - focus on key stages, user actions, and moments of positive experience.</li>
<li><span>Identify opportunities:</span> Discuss how positive experiences can be elevated, and negative experiences addressed at each stage of the experience.</li>

					<h2><span>HOW TO</span> FOR FACILITATORS</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure participants understand the flow of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Help participants choose an appropriate journey to map. Assist them as they think through positive and negative aspects of the current journey. If they are thinking about a future journey - ask them to map the stages and steps they see shaping up.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants explain the flow of the journey, and discuss any opportunity areas they might have identified.</li>
</ol>

					<h2>FACILITATORS QUESTION BANK</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>If our focus is on current experiences, do we have enough information to build journey maps? Do we have enough observations and conversations to build one?</li>
<li>Which user type or persona are you building the journey for?</li>
<li>Do you think the journey changes for another kind of user? Which other user types would you want to build journeys for?</li>
<li>What are the steps of the journey that we want to cover? Where does it start? Where does it end? Which are the steps we are the clearest about?</li>
<li>What does the user do at each of the steps? What is a user required to do? What does she actually do?</li>
<li>Which parts of the experience were positive for the user? Why so?</li>
<li>Which parts of the experience were negative for the user? Why so?</li>
<li>What are the opportunities at each step? Which step do we think has the greatest potential for intervention?</li>
<li>What would be the ideal end-to-end experience journey?</li>
