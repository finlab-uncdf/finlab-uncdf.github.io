						<p>‘Journey Maps’ are tools used in research and ideation to document the steps and emotions a respondent goes through when completing an experience. This process allows participants to contextualise the pains and joys of any given experience. The activity can be used with research respondents or as a team to contextualise research findings. </p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>USE CASES</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Identifying user actions, and key moments of delight and pain in an end to end user journey.</li>
<li>Revealing opportunities for improving experience at each step.</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>
						
						<p>A ‘Journey Map’ may not be able to accurately capture all steps of the journey and hence may miss out on a few key experiences of the journey.</p>

					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Journeys steps can vary for different types of services. The duration of ‘<span>Timeline</span>’ can be decided on depending on the experience being documented.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>What do users do?</span>’ section should be a succession of steps that describe the actions and intent of the respondent at each step.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>What do users like / not like</span>’ sections should describe joys and pains of each step.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Opportunities to improve the experience</span>’ section can be a place to call out ideas and possible solutions to the problem at hand.</li>

							<h2>STEP BY STEP</h2>

						<ol>
<li><span>Define the scope of the journey:</span> Journey Maps can be used to document a day in the life of an end user or a specific task, it should be clear from the beginning what is being mapped and at what time scale.</li>
<li><span>Map the experience:</span> Going through each step of the experience, map the touchpoints or moments that are key to completing the experience. Then consider if each point is a positive or negative experience.</li>
<li><span>Identify opportunities:</span> After documenting each step and how respondents feel about each of them, discuss as a group what might make the experience more fluid and enjoyable.</li>

					<h2><span>HOW TO</span> FOR FACILITATORS</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure the participants understand the flow of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck). </li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Help the participants assign pains and joys to the steps of the journey.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants explain the flow of the journey and any opportunity areas they might have identified.</li>
</ol>
				</div>
				
				<div class="f-question-bank">
					<h2>FACILITATORS QUESTION BANK</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Do we have enough information to build a journey? Even though we may not have documented an actual journey - do we have enough observations and conversations to build one? </li>
<li>What are the steps of the journey that we want to cover? Where does it start? Where is it intended to end? </li>
<li>Which are the steps we are the clearest about?</li>
<li>What did the user/respondent do at each of the steps of the [point to map] situation? If you were the user - what did you do? What were you required to do?</li>
<li>Which parts of the experience were positive? How so?</li>
<li>Which parts of the experience were negative? How so?</li>
<li>Do you think this journey would change for another user? Is this representative of the users that we know of?</li>
<li>What are the opportunities at each step? Which step do we think has the great opportunity? Is that something other insights and learnings are also telling us?</li>
