						<p>Journey Map is a tool used at various points (research, design, and prototyping) of the design process. It is used to document different stages, touch-points, interactions and emotions a respondent goes through as part of an end-to-end experience. Journeys may differ for different kinds of users, and for different use cases of a product or service.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>USE CASES</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Map products, services and systems as end-to-end user experience journeys.</li>
<li>Document current experiences for users.</li>
<li>Reveal opportunities for improving experience at each step.</li>
<li>Reimagine future experiences for users.</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>
						
						<p>The use of the Journey Map tool is dependent on the designer's ability to accurately map all steps of an end-to-end experience, and focus on the details.</p>

					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>The ‘<span>Timeline</span>’ is the section meant to note the scope of journey being mapped, is it end-to-end or a part of the experience?</li>
<li>The ‘<span>What do users do?</span>’ section should be a description of key user activities and tasks at each stage of the journey.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>What do users like/not like</span>’ sections should describe positive and negative aspects of the user's experience at each step of the journey.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Opportunities</span>’ section is meant to map ideas that either elevate positive experience, or address negative experience.</li>
</ul>

							<h2>STEP BY STEP</h2>
						</div>
						
						<ol>
<li><span>Define the scope:</span> Journey maps can be used to document end-to-end journeys, or a part of a journey. They may vary for different users/personas and for varied use cases. Decide what fits in scope.</li>
<li><span>Map the experience:</span> Go through each step of the journey and map interactions and touch-points that are key to the experience. Next, based on the information gathered from users, map positive and negative experiences through the course of the journey. If imagining a new journey, map what is intended at each step.</li>
<li><span>Identify opportunities:</span> Discuss how positive experiences can be elevated, and negative experiences addressed, at each stage of the experience.</li>

					<h2><span>HOW TO</span> FOR FACILITATORS</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure participants understand the flow of the activity and the directions. Refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck.</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Help participants choose an appropriate journey to map. Assist them as they think through positive and negative aspects of the journey. Help them define opportunities at each step.</li>
<li><span>At the close:</span> Have participants explain the flow of their journeys, and discuss opportunities identified.</li>

					<h2>FACILITATORS QUESTION BANK</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>If our focus is on current experiences, do we have enough information to build journey maps?</li>
<li>Which user type or persona are you building the journey for?</li>
<li>Do you think the journey changes for another kind of user? Which other user type would you want to build journeys for?</li>
<li>What are the steps of the journey that we want to cover? Where does it start and end? Which steps are the clearest?</li>
<li>What does the user do at each of the steps; What are users required to do? What do they actually do?</li>
<li>Which parts of the experience were positive for the user? Why so?</li>
<li>Which parts of the experience were negative for the user? Why so?</li>
<li>What are the opportunities at each step? Which step do we think has the greatest potential for intervention?</li>
<li>What would be the ideal end-to-end experience journey?</li>
