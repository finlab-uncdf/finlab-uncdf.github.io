					<div class="tool-about">						
						<p>Focus Group Discussions (FGD) are a format of research where researchers interact with a group (> 4) of respondents. Respondents in a group could be users or they could even be experts. A Focus Group is great to capture diversity of views, and consensus on themes relevant to the research area. Group discussions provide an opportunity for respondents to build on each other and go deep into a subject.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>USE CASES</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Build a multi-dimensional understanding of a subject</li>
<li>Understand differences in opinions and points of consensus</li>
<li>Connect with multiple voices at the same time</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>
						
						<p>If not facilitated well, participants in an FGD may not feel comfortable opening up and interacting with each other. Another risk is that for the sake of consensus, respondents may not disagree with each other. </p>

					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>The ‘<span>Lines of Questioning</span>’ is the section where the questions to be asked are to be noted.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Respondents</span>’ section can be used to write down the names and backgrounds of the participants.</li>
<li>The boxes below the respondents can be used to synthesise the discussion and fill in the answers from the respective respondents. This will also help keep track of individual answers.</li>
<li>Focus Group Discussions work alongside other tools like User Interviews, Observation, and Survey. A group discussion allows for respondents to build on each other's views so that clear consensus points and differences emerge.</li>
<li>Group discussions are usually held with 4 or more respondents. Anything more than 8 participants can lead to situations where there is cross talk and the conversation risks being disrupted.</li>

							<h2>STEP BY STEP</h2>

						<ol>
<li><span>Recruit participants:</span> Make sure participants in the focus group can provide relevant feedback and information on the topic.</li>
<li><span>Clarify questions:</span> List down lines of enquiry and follow up questions that can be used as a guide for discussion.</li>
<li><span>Conduct the focus group:</span> Choose a comfortable setting. Open by introducing yourself. Ask each respondent to introduce themselves. Give respondents enough time to provide inputs on each question. Take notes.</li>
<li><span>Review the discussion:</span> After the session, synthesise and discuss interesting points from the focus group discussions with the team.</li>

					<h2><span>HOW TO</span> FOR FACILITATORS</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Explain the activity to the participants, and discuss how to prepare for a discussion like this.</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Help the participants frame questions and outline a discussion guide.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants share their key questions. Once the group discussion is over, ask them to highlight what they found to be the most interesting or surprising.</li>

					<h2>FACILITATORS QUESTION BANK</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Have you identified the right participants for the Focus Group?</li>
<li>Do the participants know each other? How will you build trust between them?</li>
<li>Have you prepared a flow or general direction for the discussions?</li>
<li>Are you covering topics the same topics in the group discussions as you did in the interview, or are you focusing on different questions?</li>
<li>How will you keep the discussions from going off track?</li>
<li>How are you documenting the discussions?</li>
