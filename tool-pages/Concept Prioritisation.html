					<div class="tool-about">
						
						<p>The Concept Prioritisation tool helps teams prioritise the ideas they have come up with during brainstorming sessions. While a team may choose to simply vote on ideas and choose those with the highest votes, the tool here helps them consider various factors before a final choice is made.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>USE CASES</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Evaluate ideas using diverse and logical criteria.</li>
<li>Build consensus on ideas to take forward into prototyping</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>
						
						<p>Going through a detailed prioritisation exercise can be a cumbersome and exhausting experience. An alternative to using an extensive grid, is using a simpler 2x2 grid or getting teams to vote on favourite ideas.</p>

					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>On the left hand side, list the different criteria that are to be used for prioritisation. Teams should ideally use a mix of pre-defined criteria, and custom or self defined criteria. The ideas that have to be evaluated need to be mapped on the columns.</li>
<li>‘<span>It Solves for the Problem or Opportunity</span>’ is the criteria that focuses on how well an idea addresses the core problem or opportunity.</li>
<li>‘<span>It Reflects the Insights and Learnings</span>’ is the criteria that focuses on how rooted an idea is in the insights and learnings that have emerged from research.</li>
<li>‘<span>Users will Find it Desirable</span>’ is the criteria that focuses on whether the idea is something that will be welcomed by users.</li>
<li>‘<span>The Team is Excited about it</span>’ is the criteria that focuses on whether the idea is something the team is passionate about building.</li>
<li>‘<span>Other criteria</span>’ are those criteria that the team can specify themselves; costs involved, skills available, technology available, etc.. These could be some criteria to look into.</li>
<li>Scores under each of the criteria could be given individually (and then averaged or summed) or by the team as a whole. Allocation of weights to the criteria (for example to 50% to desirability, 20% to excitement, 30% to solves the problem) is a decision left to the team.</li>

<li><span>Define the criteria:</span> Define the final set of criteria to evaluate ideas on — predefined or custom.</li>
<li><span>Down-select ideas:</span> As a team, choose a set of ideas from all the different brainstorming activities the team may have done. Bring similar ideas together as one single idea.</li>
<li><span>Score ideas:</span> Assign scores (1-5 or Low, Medium, High) to each idea, individually or as a group. You may choose to assign different weights to the criteria, this makes the exercise even more robust.</li>
<li><span>Rank and review the ideas:</span> Tally the scores, and see which ideas rise to the top. Discuss top ideas with the team.</li>

					<h2><span>HOW TO</span> FOR FACILITATORS</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure participants have reviewed the tool. Help them choose a bunch of ideas from other brainstorming activities to bring into the prioritisation exercise.</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Help teams score the ideas as they move across criteria.</li>
<li><span>At the close:</span> Discuss the top ideas identified by each team.</li>
</ol>
				</div>
				
				<div class="f-question-bank">
					<h2>FACILITATORS QUESTION BANK</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Can we go through all the previous brainstorming we have done, and choose the best ideas to bring into this prioritisation exercise? What are the top 10-12 ideas that we want to prioritise amongst?</li>
<li>Do the pre-defined criteria in the first column work for you? Do you want to add more?</li>
<li>Do you want to assign any weights to the criteria?</li>
<li>Which for your team, is the most important criteria? Do the weights reflect this?</li>
<li>How do you want to score the ideas? Are you using points or some sort of a scale (low-medium-high)?</li>
<li>Do you want to vote individually first, and then see what the sums/averages are? Or, do you want to assign scores as a group from the start?</li>
<li>Do we agree with the prioritisation? Have the best ideas made it to the top?</li>
<li>If you are not happy with your prioritisation, do you want to perhaps relook at the weights you may have assigned to the criteria?</li>
