					<div class="tool-about">
						
						<p>The 'Concept Prioritisation' tool helps teams prioritise the ideas they have come up with during brainstorming sessions. While a team may choose to simply vote on ideas and choose the one with the highest votes, the tool here helps them consider various factors before a final choice is made. The tool lists a few criteria, but also encourages teams to define their own. An alternative to using an extensive grid, is using a simpler 2x2 matrix. A 2x2 could have variables such as - Investment Vs. Impact, Desirability Vs. Feasibility, Urgency Vs. Impact etc., with axes running from a high to low gradient.  </p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>USE CASES</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Evaluate ideas using diverse and logical criteria.</li>
<li>Build consensus on ideas to take forward into prototyping.</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>
						
						<p>Going through a detailed prioritisation exercise can be a cumbersome and exhausting experience. Any idea prioritisation exercise also carries the risk of degenerating into endless debate. Such debate should be avoided, and instead a healthy consensus developed within a team.</p>

					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>On the left hand side of the tool, list the different criteria that are to be used for prioritisation. Teams should ideally use a mix of pre-defined criteria, and custom or self defined criteria.</li>
<li>The ideas that have to be evaluated are mapped on the columns.</li>
<li>‘<span>It solves for the problem or opportunity</span>’ is the criteria that focuses on how well the team feels an idea  addresses the core problem or opportunity.</li>
<li>‘<span>It reflects the insights and learnings</span>’ is the criteria that focuses on how well rooted an idea is in the insights and learnings that have emerged from research.</li>
<li>‘<span>Users will find it desirable</span>’ is the criteria that focuses on whether the idea is something that will be welcomed by users - because it obviously enhances positive experience or addresses negatives.</li>
<li>‘<span>The team is excited about it</span>’ is the criteria that focuses on whether the idea is something the team is passionate about building.</li>
<li>‘<span>Other Criteria</span>’ are those criteria that the team can specify themselves - costs involved, skills available, technology available, ideas successfully implemented by competition etc. could be some criteria to look into.</li>
<li>Scores under each of the criteria could be given individually (and then averaged or summed) or by the team as a whole. Allocating weightages (for example - 50% to desirability, 20% to excitement, 20% to solves problem) to criteria is a decision left to the team.</li>

							<h2>STEP BY STEP</h2>
						</div>
						
						<ol>
<li><span>Define the criteria:</span> Define the final set of criteria to evaluate ideas on - predefined plus custom defined.</li>
<li><span>Downselect ideas:</span> As a team, choose a set of ideas from all the different brainstorming activities the team may have done. Bring similar ideas together as one single idea.</li>
<li><span>Vote on the ideas:</span> Assign values (1-5 or Low, Medium, High) to each idea then tally the votes. Voting can be done individually and scores averaged out. Teams may also choose to assign different weights to the criteria - this makes the exercise even more robust.</li>
<li><span>Rank and review the ideas:</span> Tally the votes and see which ideas rise to the top. Check if the team agrees on the top ranked ideas.</li>

					<h2><span>HOW TO</span> FOR FACILITATORS</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure participants have reviewed the tool. Help them choose a bunch of ideas from other brainstorming activities to bring into the prioritisation exercise.</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Help teams to rate the ideas, and then total the scores.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Discuss ideas that have emerged at the top for each team. Ensure there is healthy consensus on the ideas to take forward.</li>
</ol>
				</div>
				
				<div class="f-question-bank">
					<h2>FACILITATORS QUESTION BANK</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Can we go through all the previous brainstorming we have done, and choose the best ideas to bring into this prioritisation exercise? What are the top 10-12 ideas that we want to Prioritise amongst?</li>
<li>Are there ideas there that you know you just have to do? If yes, can we park them aside and focus on those we are not quite sure of?</li>
<li>Do the pre-defined criteria in the first column work for you? Do you want to add more? Do you want to remove some of the pre-defined criteria?</li>
<li>Do you want to assign any weights to the criteria? Or, do you want want to consider them as being equally important? Are you sure?</li>
<li>Which for your team is the most important criteria? Do the weights reflect this?</li>
<li>How do you want to score the ideas? Are you using points or some sort of a scale (low-medium-high)?</li>
<li>Do you want to vote individually first, and then see what the sums/averages are? Or, do you want to assign scores as a group from the start?</li>
<li>What are the scores telling us? Which ideas are rising to the top? Anything that is surprising?</li>
<li>Do we agree with the prioritisation? Have the best ideas made it to the top? If you are not happy with your prioritisation - do you want to perhaps relook at the weights you may have assigned to the criteria?</li>
<li>Is there one idea we are excited about taking into prototyping that didn't score the highest?</li>
