						<h2>About</h2>
						
						<p>The Value Proposition Canvas is a tool which helps ensure that a product or service is designed for what customers value and need. The Canvas in a sense helps develop the product-market fit. It is a part of the  broader Business Model Canvas tool, and looks  at the two parts of that tool specifically  - customer segments and value proposition.
</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>Use Cases</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Define a new product or service offering being developed from scratch - through the lens of customer needs. </li>
<li>Refine an existing product or service offering through the lens of what customers need and value</li>
<li>Link customer personas and profiles to the overall to the eventual business model. </li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>Limitations</h2>
						
						<p>Each customer profile/segment may need a unique value proposition - an overall proposition which is a combination of all the different versions may not be easy to define. Designers have to prioritise at some point. Also, in  isolation from the larger business model, the canvas may not communicate the full complexity of what needs to come together to serve customers.

					<ul>
<li>Customer Profile Map: This part  focuses on the customers</span>â€™ key characteristics and needs. A customer profile should be created for each customer segment/persona - as they may have distinct gains, pains and jobs - and value propositions can be different for each. There are three sections within the customer profile map - 1) Customer jobs -  are the functional, social and emotional tasks that customers are trying to (or could) accomplish through the use of a product or service . 2) Gains - are the benefits that customers expect those factors that can create delight while going about the jobs. 3) Pains - are the negative experiences, emotions and risks that customers  want to avoid while getting the jobs done.</li>
<li>Value Map: This part focuses on how one can design products and services to meet customer needs. Each part of this map relates back to the Customer Profile Map. There are three sections within the Value Map - 1) Products & Services - are the solutions in terms of features and systems that help customers complete the customer jobs. 2) Pain Relievers - are things that can be included in the product or service to  aid customers and reduce their pains. 3) Gain Creators - are those things in the product or service  that can help maximise customer outcomes and benefits.</li>
<li>Value Proposition: This part is to be used to summarise the overall value proposition - first for each different customer profiles and value maps. </li>

							<h2>Step by Step</h2>

						<ol>
<li><span>Familiarise yourself:</span> Read through the template and discuss what each map and each section within the map mean.</li>
<li><span>Build the Customer Profile Map:</span> Choose the customer profile/segment to build the customer profile map for. Start with the customer jobs and then move to pains and gains. Differentiate between road and specific observations. </li>
<li><span>Build the Value Map:</span> Move to the value map. Begin by detailing that product and service features that reflect the customer jobs. Move then to gain creators and pain relievers. </li>
<li><span>Define Value Proposition:</span> Summarise the overall value proposition that is evolving as a result of the exercise. Do this for each customer profile and finally as a summary across profiles. </li>
<li><span>Review & Discuss:</span> Review the findings and discuss the big takeaways and learnings as a group.</li>

					<h2>How to for Facilitators</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Start with a discussion on how well the teams understand their value proposition and if they have considered unique propositions for each customer profile. Ask teams to refer to their customer personas and business model canvases (if already developed). </li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants walk you through the worksheet they have filled out. Probe them on their final value propositions and how they have gone about driving them. </li>

					<h2>Facilitators Question Bank</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Are you looking to define a new value proposition or improve on what exists currently?</li>
<li>How well do you understand your customers? Has your research covered enough ground to be able to map your customers?</li>
<li>How many different personas and profiles do you have? Do you wish to develop customer maps for each or do you want to focus on one?</li>
<li>Are you clear on what your customer jobs are? Are these linked to the product or service features?</li>
<li>What is painful for your customers as they interact with your solution or existing solutions? How can you remove this pain?</li>
<li>What creates gain and benefit for your customers? How can you maximize this gain? </li>
<li>As you build customer and value maps for each customer segment/persona - have you considered which of the propositions and solutions to prioritise?</li>
<li>How will you prioritise them?</li>
<li>As you build customer and value maps for each customer segment/persona - what is the overall value proposition that seems to be evolving?</li>
<li>How unique is your overall value proposition?</li>
