						<h2>About</h2>
						
						<p>The NUDGE framework is a set of principles that help designers influence decisions made by people. The guiding theme is that while people should have the freedom to make their own choices, they should also be provided assistance that allows them to make better decisions. This approach to designing people’s choices is broadly called ‘Choice Architecture’.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>Use Cases</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Helping people make better decisions while interacting with a product or service at moments when they  - </li>
<li>Have multiple choices and do not fully appreciate the true costs and benefits of their actions. </li>
<li>Struggle with genuinely complex choices that require a high degree of reflection, fact finding, analysis etc.</li>
<li>Make decisions that are rare in nature and are not informed by their own experiences.</li>
<li>Need feedback on their current decisions to understand them better. </li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>Limitations</h2>
						
						<p>The NUDGE Framework is best used to influence moments where people are making a clear choice/decision. It may not be suited to changing ingrained attitudes and behaviours that may not have clear ‘choice moments’.</p>

					<h2>Understand</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>The ‘<span>Choice/Decision Moment</span>’ section is meant to note down the key action that is being taken. What is happening currently can be noted in the ‘<span>Current Choice/Decision</span>’ box, and the intended action is to be noted in  the ‘<span>Desired Choice/Decision</span>’ box.  </li>
<li>The ‘<span>User/Stakeholder Persona/Profile</span>’ box is for making a note of the key attributes - needs, attitudes, behaviours etc. that describe the person who is making the choice. </li>
<li>‘<span>Investigate Incentives</span>’ is the section where designers can list potential incentives for the users that can work as the NUDGE. Incentives can be monetary, social recognition, personal growth etc. Designers are to decide how these incentives are offered and communicated.</li>
<li>‘<span>Understand Choices</span>’ is a NUDGE approach where designer are able to communicate the costs vs. benefits of the different choices to the user, and therefore influence choice. For this to happen, the different costs and benefits needs to be mapped first, and then prioritised on the basis of what is most important for users.</li>
<li>‘<span>Consider Defaults</span>’ is a NUDGE approach where designers set  defaults on the product or service that are closest to the desired choice. An evaluation of moments when defaults are required, and how they will be set needs to be done. </li>
<li>‘<span>Give Feedback</span>’ is a NUDGE approach where designers decide on  points in the decision making process where proactive feedback can help the user make the correct choice.  An evaluation of the kind of feedback and how it will be communicated needs to be done by designers. </li>
<li>‘<span>Expect Errors</span>’ is a NUDGE approach where designers accommodate the most common errors made by users while deciding  into the design of the product or service. An evaluation of what the common errors are, and how they affect the quality of the decision needs to be done.  </li>

							<h2>Step by Step</h2>

						<ol>
<li><span>Familiarise yourself:</span> Read through the various boxes in the NUDGE template. The top is where the decision that is in focus needs to be noted. </li>
<li><span>Get started:</span> Start by calling out the persona of the target user (you can use an previously filled out persona template). Go through the NUDGE actions thereafter. Fill the middle column first, and then go to the right side. </li>
<li><span>Complete:</span> Note down your thoughts and ideas on what each of the NUDGE actions could be under the relevant boxes in the rightmost column. </li>
<li><span>Prioritise:</span> Once the worksheet is completed, discuss and prioritise ideas that could be experimented with. You could a single or multiple nudges. </li>

					<h2>How to for Facilitators</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Start with participants discussing the prospect of influencing choice and instances where their own decisions could have been improved with help. Go through the NUDGE framework step by step.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants walk you through the worksheet once they have created, and probe them on the nudges they have considered, and how they could put them into action. </li>
</ol>

					<h2>Facilitators Question Bank</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Think about your product or service solution? What are the moments when a user/stakeholder is making a choice? Can you list them down? </li>
<li>What is the critical user/stakeholder choice to focus on? Why is it important for you?</li>
<li>What are the different options in front of the user/stakeholder when they are making the choice? Why do you think they make the current choice? </li>
<li>What are the incentives that influence behaviour? What could be some incentives to try? Why?</li>
<li>What are the different kinds of costs and benefits involved with the choices? How could you communicate these to the user?</li>
<li>What is the default setting closest to the desired choice? How could you set this default?</li>
<li>How can the user benefit from feedback? What kind of feedback would this be? How would you provide it?</li>
<li>What are the kind of errors people make most commonly? What can you do to address and accommodate these errors?</li>
