						<h2>About</h2>
						
						<p>The NUDGE framework is a set of principles that help designers influence choices or decisions made by people. The guiding theme of the framework is while people should have the freedom to make their own choices, but should also be provided assistance that allows them to make better decisions. The approach is broadly called ‘Choice Architecture’.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>Use Cases</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Helping people make better decisions while interacting with a product or service. </li>
<li>Have multiple choices and do not fully appreciate the true costs and benefits of their actions. </li>
<li>Struggle with genuinely complex choices that require a high degree of reflection, fact finding, analysis etc.</li>
<li>Make decisions that are rare in nature and are not informed by their own experiences.</li>
<li>Need feedback on their current decisions to understand them better. </li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>Limitations</h2>
						
						<p>The NUDGE Framework is best used to influence moments where people are making a clear choice/decision. It may not be suited to changing ingrained attitudes and behaviors that may not have clear ‘choice moments’.

					<h2>Understand</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>The ‘<span>Choice/Decision Moment</span>’ section is meant for you to note down the key action/moment that is being focused on. You can call out what is happening current in the ‘<span>Current Choice/Decision</span>’ box, and the action you are intending to generate in the ‘<span>Desired Choice/Decision</span>’ box.  </li>
<li>The ‘<span>User/Stakeholder Persona/Profile</span>’ box is meant to note down the key attributes - needs, attitudes, behaviors etc. that can help bring the user in sharp focus. A prefilled persona template (in case available) can be used instead of doing this again. </li>
<li>‘<span>Investigate INcentives</span>’ is the section in which you look at what could be incentives that could be the NUDGE solution. Incentives can be monetary, social, effort etc. It is important to first note down all incentives that you think are relevant before choosing the ones to be explored further. The idea is that the right incentives can influence the choice if communicated/offered to the user.</li>
<li>‘<span>Understand Choices</span>’ is the section in which the costs vs. benefits of the different choices before the user/stakeholder are to be first mapped - and then a decision taken on how  these trade offs are to be communicated. The theory is that communicating these trade offs to users helps them choose better. </li>
<li>‘<span>Consider Defaults</span>’ is the section in which the designer evaluates default settings on the product or service that can help users make the right decision. The theory is that users can benefit from default that are closely linked to the desired choice. </li>
<li>‘<span>Give Feedback</span>’ is the section in which one has to consider points in the choice/decision at which feedback would help the user make the right choice. The designer has to consider what this feedback is and when it should be provided. </li>
<li>‘<span>Expect Errors</span>’ is the section in which the designer should consider accommodating the most common errors made by the user while choosing/deciding  so that they don</span>’t impact the overall quality of choice.</li>

							<h2>Step by Step</h2>

						<ol>
<li><span>Familiarise yourself:</span> Read through the various boxes in the NUDGE template. At the top is where the choice/decision that is the focus is to be noted. </li>
<li><span>Get started:</span> Start by calling out the persona of the target user (you can use an previously filled out persona template). Go through the NUDGE actions thereafter. Fill the middle column first, and then go to the right side. </li>
<li><span>Complete:</span> Note down your thoughts and ideas on what each of the NUDGE actions could be under the relevant boxes in the rightmost column. </li>
<li><span>Prioritise:</span> Once the worksheet is completed, discuss and prioritise ideas that could be experimented with. You could a single or multiple nudges. </li>

					<h2>How to for Facilitators</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Start with participants’ discussing the prospect of influencing choice and instances where their own choices/decisions could have been improved by the right inputs. Go through the NUDGE framework step by step.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants walk you through the worksheet once they have created and probe on what their nudges are aimed to achieve and how they will test them.</li>

					<h2>Facilitators Question Bank</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Think about your product or service solution? What are the moments when a user/stakeholder is making a choice? Can you list them down? </li>
<li>What is the critical user/stakeholder choice to focus on? Why is it important for you?</li>
<li>What are the different choices in front of the user/stakeholder? Why do you think they make the current choice? </li>
<li>What are the incentives that influence behavior? How do you think users/stakeholders see choices currently? </li>
<li>What are the incentives to focus on?</li>
<li>What are the different kinds of costs and benefits involved with the choices? How can you explain these trade offs better?</li>
<li>Are there any default options that could be experimented with? </li>
<li>What are the kind of errors people make most commonly? What can you do to bake these errors into your design?</li>
