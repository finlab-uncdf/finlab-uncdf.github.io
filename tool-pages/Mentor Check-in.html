					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>The template provided is only meant to be a representative agenda for a mentor-participant discussion. Reasonable time must be allocated to each part of the conversation.</li>
<li>It is important that at least in the first conversation, participants introduce themselves and their role at the organization they are representing. A script for this can be noted in the ‘<span>Introduce yourself</span>’ section.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Present your product or service</span>’ is the core of mentor-participant conversation. This could be done using a pitch deck or a business plan document - at least for the first time. If this is a repeat or a regular conversation - the discussion can be a much more focused on an aspect that the mentor and participant have interest in engaging on.</li>
<li>‘<span>Collect feedback</span>’ is the part of the conversation in which participants can share points they'd like feedback on. Based on the theme of the conversation, Mentors are likely to have their own questions and inputs at this stage.</li>

							<h2>STEP BY STEP</h2>
						</div>
						
						<ol>
<li><span>Do your research:</span> Before choosing a mentor to speak to, consider which ones are most likely to have relevant inputs to provide. Check for their availability if speaking to them outside of a workshop setting.</li>
<li><span>Set up the call:</span> Whether in person or online, make sure the mentor is available and has all the information they need about you. Mentors may want to see the elevator deck, or a detailed business plan before meeting you. On your end, prepare a few key questions you'd like to discuss, and try and send these over to the mentor before the meeting.</li>
<li><span>Keep in touch:</span> If a valuable relationship starts, make sure to keep them in the loop about your progress.</li>

					<h2><span>HOW TO</span> FOR FACILITATORS</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>Prior to the session:</span> Help make the mentor-participant connect. If happening offline at a workshop - this should be easier. However, if the mentors and participants are coordinating online - ensure that each participant has found at least one relevant mentor to speak to.</li>
<li><span>During the check-in:</span> If this is part of a workshop, and participants and mentors are networking -  ensure that participants get to speak to relevant mentors, and get enough time with mentors.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have mentors and participants share their feedback on the experience.</li>
</ol>
