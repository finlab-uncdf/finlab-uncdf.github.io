						<h3><span>STRATEGY, INNOVATION & IMPACT |</span> VISION BUILDING</h3>
						
						<h1>Theory of Change</h1>
						
						<p class="time">90-120 Min</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-about">						
						<p>Theory of Change (TOC) is a framework to map 'desired change' against input activities and investments. It helps innovators build relevant strategies for change by differentiating between results and impact. The framework also helps link long term and short-term goals - creating a logical flow that can be used to guide efforts.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>USE CASES</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Create an end to end summary of the intended impact strategy of a programme or business at conceptualisation. </li>
<li>Diagnose and reflect on actual impact, and finetune strategy. </li>
<li>Identify human and resource investments needed to create impact. </li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>LIMTATIONS</h2>
						
						<p>While the TOC helps identify potential strategy, there is little guarantee that activities and resources identified once will guarantee impact on ground. TOCs are often revisited and refined as data from the ground starts emerging.</p>

					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>The ‘<span>Resources & Inputs</span>’ section is to meant to park the human, knowledge, skill, financial, technological, infrastructural, systemic capabilities that are required to create impact. </li>
<li>‘<span>Activities</span>’ are those tasks that the resources will help undertake. The nature of these tasks could be both user facing (awareness building, onboarding, servicing etc.) and internal (process development, skill building, hiring, technology adoption etc.). Investors need to be convinced that resources are being spent on priority activities. </li>
<li>‘<span>Outputs</span>’ are the most basic numbers and metrics that help measure results achieved because of investments made. Without going into whether the efforts were successful or not, the outputs help understand the extent of effort (for example - number of people reached, campaigns undertaken, number of learning sessions held etc.) </li>
<li>‘<span>Outcomes</span>’ are deeper metrics than outputs and start focusing on both the quantity and quality of results. The stress is importantly on short-medium term impact metrics (for example - level of awareness in people because of campaign, skills built in people because of x number of learning sessions etc.) </li>
<li>‘<span>Impact</span>’ focuses on longer term shifts - on real, lasting impact created by interventions. The translation of outcomes and outputs into change is really brought to the fore here (for example - does awareness lead to better decision making and choice?, do skills lead to an enhanced ability to be financially empowered? etc.)</li>
<li>‘<span>Assumptions</span>’ are risk factors that an innovator needs to keep in mind as the TOC is being built. Assumptions are important to study and adjust as implementation is done.</li>
</ul>

							<h2>STEP BY STEP</h2>

						<ol>
<li><span>Define a vision:</span> Discuss the intended impact of the program or service with your team.</li>
<li><span>Unpack the necessary resources:</span> First fill in the left side of the tool to list the basic financial, staff and network resources needed (or available) to roll out the programme. List down activities that these resources would help carry out. </li>
<li><span>Link the efforts to the impact:</span> Link resources and activities to outputs (short-term) and outcomes (long-term) that will lead to the intended impact.</li>
<li><span>Identify blindspots:</span> Before ending the session, review the template and look for assumptions you might be making at each step and overall for the program. </li>

					<h2><span>HOW TO</span> FOR FACILITATORS</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck). </li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Start with participants’ existing knowledge of the activity to create a first version of the map. Discuss with them about how they measure the impact of their own investments. </li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants walk you through the map, and at each step question them on their approach to their plans and assumptions. </li>
</ol>

				<div class="f-question-bank">
					<h2>FACILITATORS QUESTION BANK</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>What is the long-term impact that you want to create? </li>
<li>What are some key resources and capabilities that you have access to?</li>
<li>What sort of activities are your current resources and capabilities utilized for? </li>
<li>What kind of quantitative results or outputs (short and long term) do your resources and activities help you create? Do these outputs help you achieve desired long-term change? </li>
<li>What are the desired output levels? What kind of additional resources do you need to get to these levels? How do you plan to access these resources?</li>
<li>What kind of qualitative change or outcomes (short and long term) will the current output levels help you produce? Do these outcomes achieve your long-term change goal?</li>
<li>What are the desired outcomes? What kind of additional outputs do you need to get to desired outcomes? How do you plan to create these outputs?</li>
<li>What kind of impact will current outcomes and outputs help achieve? How does this level of impact compare to desired long-term change? </li>
<li>What are some key assumptions at each stage of the mapping? What can we do to minimise risk from these assumptions? </li>
<li>If we were to aim for desirable long-term change - what would a supporting pool of resources and capabilities look like? Is it feasible to consider if these resources can be raised? How?</li>
<li>What are some activities that additional resources would help undertake? How will these activities help achieve desired outputs and outcomes?</li>
