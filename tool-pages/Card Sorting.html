						<h1>Card Sorting</h1>

					<div class="tool-about">						
						<p>Card Sorting is a research activity in which respondents are given cards that carry certain visual cues, and are then asked to arrange these cards in an order relevant to the research enquiry. Cards sorting replaces survey type questions that ask respondents to prioritise, group or react to certain product, service, or system aspects. The visual nature of cards helps minimise loss in translation, and increases engagement during research. Discussing the card sorting while it is taking place helps understand respondent attitudes and needs. </p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>USE CASES</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Map user preferences with regards to competing options</li>
<li>Map sequence of events in a journey of use</li>
<li>Map users' perceptions with regards to a product or service</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>
						
						<p>Visuals on cards can impact understanding - contextualization and localization are a must. Any card sort with more than 20-30 cards risks overwhelming respondents. Card sorting requires researchers to take respondents through each card before they start, and explain the purpose of the exercise. Setting context helps minimise confusion. </p>

					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>The most critical thing while deciding on a card sort is to define purpose clearly. Purpose should ideally be derived from the lines of enquiry identified in the research plan. A card sort can be done to - 1) Map preference - for example, what kind of onboarding approaches do users like?, 2) Map sequence - what should be the steps in an ideal hotel check in?, 3) Map association - which brands are premium and which are value for money?</li>
<li>Visual cards are used in contexts where respondents can't fully describe their choices using words - for example, can users pick between different digital onboarding journeys without visual support?</li>
<li>The choice of visuals on the cards, and the number of cards is dependent on the purpose of the research.</li>
<li>Visuals on cards can be images, sketches, screenshots etc. These visuals represent things that are to be Prioritised, sequenced or categorised.</li>
</ul>

							<h2>STEP BY STEP</h2>
						</div>
						
						<ol>
<li><span>Define an objective:</span> Card sorting is a very versatile tool. You should be clear on why you are using it.</li>
<li><span>Prepare a deck:</span> A card deck should have 10-20 cards where each card is distinct. Make sure that images are clear and easily understood.</li>
<li><span>Lay the cards out:</span> Before starting the activity with a respondent, lay the cards out before them, and explain the specific objective of the exercise.</li>
<li><span>Discuss and organise:</span> As respondents do the card sort, discuss their thought process.</li>
</ol>

					<h2><span>HOW TO</span> FOR FACILITATORS</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure the participants understand the flow of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Help the teams create the cards and plan the discussion with the research participants.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants explain how the session played out, and the responses from the discussion.</li>
</ol>

					<h2>FACILITATORS QUESTION BANK</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>What purpose could card sorting potentially help you achieve? Are you looking to Prioritise, sequence, or categorise something?</li>
<li>How many cards are you planning to create? Are all of them essential? Which are the most important?</li>
<li>What kind of visuals are you planning to use? Are the visuals simple enough for users to understand?</li>
<li>Are the visuals you are using localised/contextualised to the respondents you will be meeting?</li>
<li>Are you planning the card sort as a separate activity? Or, are you planning to integrate it within user interviews?</li>
<li>What are some questions you would like to ask respondents as they go about the card sort?</li>
<li>Do you want to rehearse the activity?</li>
