						<h2>USE CASES</h2>

Also set up the room so that people can easily circulate in the space:</span> chairs should be set up in rows of pairs.</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Keep track of time and use a bell or music to make sure everyone knows when it is time to rotate and adheres to it.</li>
