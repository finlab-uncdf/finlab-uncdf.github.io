					<div class="tool-about">						
						<p>The Speed Dating format is used to facilitate rapid and diverse conversations - participant-participant introductions, participant-mentor discussions, elevator pitch practice etc. in a fun way.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>USE CASES</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Create multiple conversations in a short period of time.</li>
<li>Introduce diverse sets of people to each other.</li>
<li>Provide multi-dimensional feedback.</li>
<li>Practice presentation and storytelling skills.</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>
						
						<p>Speed Dating formats typically leave little room for long, detailed discussions - the facilitator should allocate reasonable time for conversations based on the goal of the session. </p>

					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>In Speed Dating formats, two groups of people (like participants and mentors) are arranged such that while individuals from one group remains stationed at one spot (say mentors), the other set of individuals (participants) remain mobile and spend predetermined time at the stations (for a participant-mentor discussion). As time for conversation lapses, individuals from the mobile group move to the next station to have another conversation. This continues till an intended number of conversations have taken place.</li>
<li>‘<span>Talking Points</span>’ are essentially the key aspects that the conversation should be focused on - this depends on the nature of the session. For participant-mentor discussions, participants are encouraged to practice their elevator pitches for example, and have questions ready based on the backgrounds of the mentors.</li>

					<h2><span>HOW TO</span> FOR FACILITATORS</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>Prior to the session:</span> Make sure everyone is aware of the time they will be given and what will be discussed. Also, set up the room so that the mobile group can easily circulate between the stations.</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Keep track of time, and use a bell or music to communicate when it is time for people to move to the next station. Ensure everyone adheres to the time limit.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants share their takeaways, what worked and what didn‘t.</li>
</ol>

				<div class="f-question-bank">
					<h2>FACILITATORS QUESTION BANK</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Is everyone clear on what they will be discussing and how much time we will have?</li>
<li>Do you have a clear idea of what you want to get across?</li>
<li>Do we know who is stationary and how is mobile?</li>
<li>Should we do a practice run before we start?</li>
<li>Can we please keep moving when we are done?</li>
<li>What did we all learn from the exercise? Do you have any feedback to share?</li>
