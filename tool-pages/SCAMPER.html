						<p>SCAMPER is a tool that was first conceptualised as an aid for creative thinking by children. Today, it is widely used as an aid for problem solving. The tool lists seven potential strategies for solutioning.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>USE CASES</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Brainstorm on ideas to improve a current product or service.</li>
<li>Think through the dimensions of an idea.</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>
						
						<p>The SCAMPER tool is a great way to approach changes to an existing product to service, which may seem incremental. It may be a limited tool when it comes to identifying breakthrough ideas.</p>

					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>The ‘<span>Substituting</span>’ box is meant for ideas that look at substituting or changing a certain part of the product, service or system to solve the problem.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Combining</span>’ box is meant for ideas that look at combining two or more parts of the product, service or system to solve the problem.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Adapting</span>’ box is meant for ideas that look to adapt/alter/adjust certain parts of the product, service or system to solve the problem.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Modifying</span>’ box is meant for ideas that either maximise or minimise existing parts of the product, service or system to solve the problem.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Putting</span>’ or 'Put to Another Use' box is meant for ideas that use one or more parts of a product, service or system in another way to solve the problem.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Eliminating</span>’ box is meant for ideas in which a part of the product, service or system can be eliminated in order to solve the problem.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Rearranging</span>’ box is meant for ideas where parts of a product, service or system are rearranged to solve the problem.</li>

<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure everyone understands the different boxes in the template.</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Have everyone work on their own ideas, consider timing sessions (3-5 min) for individual brainstorming under each strategy. Encourage group brainstorming at the end of each session (5-7 min).</li>
<li><span>At the close:</span> Have teams share their most impressive ideas, and discuss emerging patterns.</li>

					<h2>FACILITATORS QUESTION BANK</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Are we clear about the seven solutioning strategies under SCAMPER?</li>
<li>Would you like to go over each strategy one by one, or would you want to think for all at one go?</li>
<li>Do you want to start with individual brainstorming? Or would you like to brainstorm in a group?</li>
<li>What are some patterns emerging under each of the strategies? What are some big ideas that you see as a group?</li>
<li>Which are your best ideas? How are you choosing them?</li>
