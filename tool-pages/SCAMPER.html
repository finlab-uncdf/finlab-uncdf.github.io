						<p>SCAMPER is a tool that was first conceptualised as an aid for creative thinking for children. Today, it is widely used in organizations across the world as an aid for problem solving. SCAMPER lists seven potential strategies for problem solvers, and is best used to look at enhancements to existing products and services. </p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>USE CASES</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Brainstorm on ideas to improve a current product or service.</li>
<li>Identify ideas that cover a healthy range of possibilities.</li>
<li>Make ideation a focused yet enjoyable exercise.</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>
						
						<p>The SCAMPER tool is great to approach changes to an existing product to service - which often may seem incremental. It is a limited tool when it comes to identifying breakthrough or moonshot ideas. </p>

					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>

<li>In the ‘<span>Adapting</span>’ box, participants should list ideas that look to adapt/alter/adjust certain parts of the product, service or system to solve the problem.</li>
<li>In the ‘<span>Modifying</span>’ box, participants should list ideas that either maximise or minimise existing parts of the product, service or system to solve the problem,.</li>
<li>In the ‘<span>Putting</span>’ or "Put to Another Use' box participants should list ideas that can use one or more parts of a product, service or system in another way to solve the problem.</li>
<li>In the ‘<span>Eliminating</span>’ box, participants should list parts of the product, service or system they can eliminate in order to solve the problem.</li>

<li><span>Choose a Challenge:</span> Review the design challenges and focus on one to take into ideation. Keep the Persona, Insights, and Key Takeaways handy.</li>
<li><span>Brainstorm:</span> Think of as many ideas as possible - individually and as a group. Write ideas down on sticky notes and park them in relevant columns.</li>
<li><span>Discuss:</span> Discuss ideas that seem most relevant and have potential. Discuss a combination of strategies to solve the problem.</li>

					<h2><span>HOW TO</span> FOR FACILITATORS</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure everyone understands the different boxes in the template.</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Have everyone work on their own ideas, consider timing sessions at 3 minutes for individual brainstorming under each strategy. Brainstorm as a group for another 5-10 min.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have teams share their ideas. Ask them to share any patterns emerging, and discuss their most important ideas.</li>

					<h2>FACILITATORS QUESTION BANK</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Are we all clear on each of the strategies are different from each other? It is okay to park ideas where they seem best fit.</li>
<li>Would you like to go over each strategy one by one, or would you want to think for all at one go?</li>
<li>Do you want to start with individual brainstorming? Or would you like to brainstorm in a group?</li>
<li>What are some patterns emerging under each of the strategies? What are some big ideas that you see as a group?</li>
<li>Would it help if you approached the solution as a combination of the different strategies?</li>
<li>Which are your best ideas? How are you choosing them?</li>
