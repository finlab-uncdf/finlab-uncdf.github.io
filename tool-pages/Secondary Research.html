					<div class="tool-about">						
						<p>Secondary research is done by reviewing published knowledge and news content (i.e. not in person research with users and other stakeholders) and through conversations with experts. Secondary research can be done via online and offline channels. </p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>USE CASES</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Map competitors to compare and understand relative strengths and weaknesses</li>
<li>Build a foundational understanding of broad political, economic, social, cultural, technological, environmental and legal trends</li>
<li>Understand events, opinions, decisions, trends etc. with regards to specific products, services, and organizations</li>
<li>Understand an emerging theme or topic from a multi-dimensional angle</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>LIMTATIONS</h2>
						
						<p>Secondary research can be very time consuming and confusing - the nature, quality, and range of sources to include in research is crucial to consider. </p>

					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>The ‘<span>Competition Benchmark</span>’ is type of secondary research where the focus is on understanding competitors.</li>
<li>‘<span>Trend & Ecosystem Scanning</span>’ is the kind of secondary research that focuses on understanding broad ecosystem level events and changes.</li>
<li>There could be several sources - consumer reports, news sites, blogs etc. and channels - online and offline that researchers can use to collect information.</li>
<li>As research is carried out, researchers should make a note of key data points and learnings that they come across.</li>

							<h2>STEP BY STEP</h2>
						</div>
						
						<ol>
<li><span>Identify knowledge gaps:</span> Before starting secondary research, review the research plan and make a note of lines of enquiry and key questions</li>
<li><span>Choose your approach:</span> Depending on what needs to be researched, choose particular sources and approaches (online, offline, articles, books etc.) that come to mind.</li>
<li><span>Document progress:</span> Keep track of sources and document key information collected (use the templates) so that other team members can refer back to your research.</li>

					<h2><span>HOW TO</span> FOR FACILITATORS</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Explain the activity to the participants, if participants are feeling stuck, help them by filling out a row with them.</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Make sure that they refer to the previous tools to focus on the lines of inquiry and key questions that have been previously identified.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants share their plan (before they move forward with research) and check if their approach is comprehensive while still being simple.</li>

					<h2>FACILITATORS QUESTION BANK</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Looking at the Problem Tree and the Stakeholder Map, are there areas we need more clarity on?</li>
<li>What lines of enquiry and key questions emerged during research planning? Are there additional things we need to consider?</li>
<li>What kind of sources and channels will you use to do your research?</li>
<li>How will the information collected help you move the project forward?</li>
