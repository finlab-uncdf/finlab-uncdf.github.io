					<div class="tool-about">
						<h2>About</h2>
						
						<p>Secondary research is done by reviewing existing knowledge and news content  (i.e. not in person research with users and other stakeholders) and in conversations with experts. The research can be done on online or offline channels. </p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>Use Cases</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Understanding competition by mapping existing solutions and competitors to understand what’s working and what’s not, assess trends and decisions taken by other actors.</li>
<li>Gaining a foundational understanding of broader political, economic, social, cultural,  technological, environmental and legal trends that may be influential.</li>
<li>Making sure the team is informed and prepared to meet users or experts. It can also continue in parallel if teams feel that there is value in doing so.</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>Limitations</h2>
						
						<p>Secondary research can be very time consuming, consider planning your research by listing knowledge gaps it should address before starting.</p>

					<h2>Understand</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>The ‘<span>Competition Benchmark</span>’ is a great way to get started with secondary research. Building off of their Stakeholder Map (not compulsory but recommended), participants can run through several sources (consumer reports, news sites, blogs) to explore how similar competitors have met the needs of their users.</li>
<li>‘<span>Trend & Ecosystem Scanning</span>’ will provide a broad look at relevant innovation, best practices, and forces influencing the space or ecosystem participants are hoping to tackle.</li>

							<h2>Step by Step</h2>
						</div>
						
						<ol>
<li><span>Identify knowledge gaps:</span> Before starting secondary research, review the work done in the Foundation phase and highlight the knowledge gaps identified there.</li>
<li><span>Choose your approach:</span> Depending on what needs to be researched, choose if you’d like to start by looking at the competition or if you’d like to get a broader perspective of the ecosystem.</li>
<li><span>Document progress:</span> Keep track of sources and highlight key information using the templates provided  so other team members can refer back to your research.</li>

					<h2>How to for Facilitators</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Explain the activity to the participants, if participants are feeling stuck, help them by filling out a row with them.</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Make sure that they refer to the previous tools to include lines of inquiry or knowledge gaps that they had previously identified.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have the participants share their plan and see if they have assigned the research methods that seem relevant to the lines of inquiry and that the participants feel comfortable using.</li>
</ol>

					<h2>Facilitators Question Bank</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Looking  at the Problem Tree and the Stakeholder Map, are there areas we need more clarity on?</li>
<li>Where should we try to find this information (Report / Social Media / Online forums)?</li>
<li>How will this information help us move the project forward?</li>
