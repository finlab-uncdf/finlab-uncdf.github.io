						<h2>About</h2>
						
						<p>Attribute Scale is a method  that helps measure and compare user needs and feedback with regards to different products, services, experiences etc. The tool uses a set of scales (attributes) with two ends that are opposites, such as - “physical” and “digital,” “affordable” and “premium,” etc. On each scale, users are mapped based on data available.  Once mapped, patterns and trends are analysed for insight.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>Use Cases</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Map the experience of current users with regards to different product or service attributes and compare.</li>
<li>Map attitudes and needs of potential users with regards to attributes of a future product or service. </li>
<li>Inform the build of personas and profiles.</li>
<li>Map the qualities of competitors / other market players on attribute scale.</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>Limitations</h2>
						
						<p>The Attribute Scale is useful when teams have a robust sense of the comparison they plan to map, and also have a consensus on how scores on each attribute are decided. It should be as objective a decision as possible - ideally informed by research. </p>

					<h2>Understand</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Attributes are the qualities/features/offerings for which user needs and views need to be   scored -  pricing, personalisation, digitization, frequency of mailers  etc. are some examples of the kind of  attributes designers may want to compare users on. </li>
<li>Scale is the way to score users needs and views on the attributes. Typically these can be represented by two extremes points (low-high). Another way to express the extremes is in terms of opposites (for example - physical or digital).</li>
<li>Entities are the those things that need to be scored and compared on the attributes . These could be users (for example - young, middle age, old customers), competitors (for example - startups, small companies, established companies), products and services (for example - different car models, apps, banking experiences), geographies (for example - rural, urban, peri urban) etc. Comparison between the entities helps the designer arrive at patterns and insights.</li>
<li>Scores are the points on the scales that are representing a particular entity</span>’s need or view with regards to an attribute. </li>
<li>Score lines are the lines connecting the scores of one entity across the different attributes - creating a visual path that can be used for comparison between entities. </li>
<li>Patterns are the visual and data trends that emerge once the mapping of  score lines is completed. </li>
</ul>

							<h2>Step by Step</h2>
						</div>
						
						<ol>
<li><span>Familiarise yourself:</span> Read through the various sections in the Attribute Scale template. Decide what the tool is being used for - profile building, competitor benchmark etc.</li>
<li><span>Attributes, Scale & Entities:</span> Make a list of attributes that are the most important to map. Decide what scale extremes are relevant for each of the attributes. Next decide on the entities that need to be mapped on the scale, entities can be team members, personas or business competitors or any other entities you wish to compare. </li>
<li><span>Map Scores:</span> Go attribute by attribute and map each entity on the scales defined. Connect scores on each attribute to create a visual mapping. </li>
<li><span>Review Patterns & Discuss:</span> Review the patterns that are emerging across the different entities and discuss if they present new insights.</li>

					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Start with a discussion on what attributes need to be mapped, and which entities need to be compared. Ask the teams to also define the scales for each attribute. Guide them while they map and question on how they arrive at scores. </li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants walk you through the worksheet they have filled out and probe them on their mapping of the attributes and what it means in terms of patterns and insights. </li>

					<h2>Facilitators Question Bank</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>What are we looking to map during this exercise? What will this attribute mapping help you achieve?</li>
<li>Are we clear on the attributes and the entities? </li>
<li>Are your scales under each attribute well defined? </li>
<li>Are your entities - users or organisations or products or something else? </li>
<li>Can you see patterns emerging visually as you are going through the mapping? What are these patterns telling - What’s the insight?</li>
<li>How has the comparison created clarity for the team if any?</li>
<li>How else can you make use of this tool?</li>
