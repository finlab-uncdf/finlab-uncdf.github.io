					<div class="tool-about">						
						<p>Attribute Scale is a tool that helps map and compare user needs and feedback with regards to different products, services, experiences etc. The tool uses a set of scales (for each of the attributes) with two ends that are opposites, such as - “physical” and “digital,” “affordable” and “premium,” etc. On each scale, users are mapped based on data available, and patterns are analysed for insight.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>USE CASES</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Map the experience of current users with regards to different product or service attributes and compare</li>
<li>Map attitudes and needs of potential users with regards to attributes of a future product or service</li>
<li>Inform the build of personas and profiles</li>
<li>Compare competitors on different attributes - product features, service experience, brand perception etc.</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>LIMTATIONS</h2>
						
						<p>The Attribute Scale is useful when teams have a robust sense of the comparison they plan to map, and also have a consensus on how scores on each attribute are decided. The exercise should ideally be informed by research. </p>

					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>‘<span>Attributes</span>’ are the qualities/features/offerings - for example - pricing, personalisation, digitization, frequency of mailers etc. - that designers may want to compare entities on. There can be multiple attributes as required.</li>
<li>‘<span>Scales</span>’ serve as a measure of attributes. They are used to score entities, and are typically defined by two extremes points (low - high) or in terms of opposites (physical - digital).</li>
<li>‘<span>Entities</span>’ are those things that need to be compared. These could be users (for example - young, middle age, old customers), competitors (for example - startups, small companies, established companies), products and services (for example - different car models, apps, banking experiences), geographies (for example - rural, urban, peri urban) etc. Comparison between the entities helps designers arrive at patterns and insights.</li>
<li>‘<span>Scores</span>’ are points on the attribute scales that best describe an entity. </li>
<li>Score lines connect scores of one entity across the different attributes - creating a visual path that can be used for comparison between entities. </li>
<li>Patterns are the visual trends that emerge once the mapping of score lines is complete. </li>
</ul>

							<h2>STEP BY STEP</h2>
						</div>
						
						<ol>
<li><span>Familiarise yourself:</span> Read through the various sections in the Attribute Scale template. Decide what use case makes sense for your need.</li>
<li><span>Attributes, Scale & Entities:</span> Make a list of attributes that are most important to map. Decide what scale extremes are relevant for each of the attributes. Next, decide on the actual entities that need to be mapped on the scale. Entities can be users, products or services, organizations or any other relevant entities that need to be compared. </li>
<li><span>Map Scores:</span> Go attribute by attribute, and map each entity on the scales. Draw lines to connect scores on each attribute (for each entity). </li>
<li><span>Review Patterns & Discuss:</span> Review patterns emerging, and discuss learnings and insights.</li>

					<h2><span>HOW TO</span> FOR FACILITATORS</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Start with a discussion on what attributes need to be mapped, and which entities need to be compared. Ask the teams to also define the scales for each attribute. Guide them while they map, and question how they arrive at scores. </li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants walk you through the worksheet they have filled out. Probe them on their mapping, and discuss what it means in terms of insights. </li>
</ol>

					<h2>FACILITATORS QUESTION BANK</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>What are you looking to map during this exercise? What will the attribute mapping help you achieve?</li>
<li>Are you clear on the attributes? How did you arrive at them?</li>
<li>Are your entities - users or organisations or products or something else? How did you choose them?</li>
<li>Are your scales under each attribute well defined? How did you arrive at these scales?</li>
<li>Can you see patterns emerging visually as you are going about drawing score lines? What are the patterns telling - What’s the insight?</li>
<li>How has the comparison created clarity for the team if any?</li>
<li>What was missing in this exercise? Would greater data have helped?</li>
