						<h1>SWITCH Framework</h1>
						
						<p class="time">60-90 Min</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-about">
						
						<p>The Switch Framework is widely used to guide behaviour change approaches, especially in the behaviour change communication domain. The model proposes that there are three elements of behaviour; the rational side (The Rider), the emotional side (The Elephant), and the environment (The Path); and that one can change behaviour if interventions take these three elements into account. The framework was proposed by Chip Heath and Dan Heath in their book - Switch: How to Change Things When Change Is Hard.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>USE CASES</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Identify how a product or service may achieve behaviour change.</li>
<li>Identify how behaviour change may be realised in the context of use of a specific product or service.</li>
<li>Identify a communication or advertising strategy for a behavior change initiative.</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>
						
						<p>While the SWITCH model is great in terms of highlighting different aspects of how behaviour change can be approached, it is dependent on a robust understanding of behaviours and motivations in the first place. Without the understanding, it is likely that the interventions designed will end up tackling superficial symptoms and not the root cause.</p>

					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>The framework provides three broad elements that account for logical (Rider), emotional (Elephant), and environmental (Path) aspects of behaviour change.</li>
<li>‘<span>Direct The Rider</span>’: Behaviour change can happen when we provide crystal clear direction to the ‘<span>rational side</span>’ (The Rider) of a person who is to adopt a behaviour. To be able to appeal to the rational side, one can follow three strategies; 1) Follow The Bright Spots - Build on existing positive behaviours and success stories, learn from people with positive behaviours, and use that to influence others and design interventions 2) Script the Critical Moves - Dissolve the resistance by breaking down the change into specific tasks, identify clear actions that can be implemented, and how they contribute to change 3) Point to the Destination - Create a specific goal that people can work towards and respond to, define an end state that is logical and worth aspiring to.</li>
<li>‘<span>Motivate The Elephant</span>’: Behaviour change can happen when we engage a person</span>’s emotions (The Elephant). To appeal to people</span>’s ‘<span>emotional</span>’ side, one can follow three strategies; 1) Find the Feeling - Make people feel positively inspired to change, identify what motivations exist and how they can be enhanced 2) Shrink The Change: Break down seemingly large complex change into simple, small steps until it no longer seems daunting 3) Grow Your People: Identify skills, knowledge, resources, tools, rewards etc. that can help equip people for change.</li>
<li>‘<span>Shape The Path</span>’: Behaviour change can happen when one changes the context (The Path) in which action is happening. To be able to create an enabling ‘<span>environment</span>’, one can follow three strategies; 1) Tweak the Environment: Tweak elements in the physical environment that are bottlenecks, and/or introduce new elements that can enable desired behaviour 2) Build Habits: Translate behaviour change into habits by identifying ways to make desired behaviour repeatable and consistent, provide for cycles of learning 3) Rally the Herd: Get change recognised and supported by other people, identify ways to inform and involve groups in the change process.</li>

							<h2>STEP BY STEP</h2>

						<ol>
<li><span>Familiarise yourself:</span> Read through the various boxes in the SWITCH template. At the top is where the current behaviour and the desired behaviour are to be noted.</li>
<li><span>Get started:</span> Start with the Rider, and map out ideas and thoughts under each of the three sub aspects. Follow the same process for Elephant and Rider.</li>
<li><span>Refine & Review:</span> See how the different aspects are connected to each other. Discuss a comprehensive strategy that builds on the three elements.</li>

					<h2><span>HOW TO</span> FOR FACILITATORS</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure participants understand the goal of the activity and the direction. Refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck.</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Start with participants’ understanding of current behaviours being displayed, and discuss the behaviour change desired. Discuss the three components of behaviour change from the SWITCH Framework; rational (Rider), emotional (Elephant), and environmental (Path).</li>
<li><span>At the close:</span> Have participants walk you through the worksheet, and probe them on what a comprehensive strategy looks like.</li>
</ol>

					<h2>FACILITATORS QUESTION BANK</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>What is the behaviour change you are focusing on? Why is that your focus?</li>
<li>Are you looking to create behaviour change through your product or service? Or, are you looking to change the way people interact with your product or service?</li>
<li>Why do you think it is important to appeal to people’s rational side? How do you want to do it? Are there any bright spots or current positive behaviours you can learn from?</li>
<li>What specific behaviours do you want people to adopt? How can you break change down into logical steps with clear impact?</li>
<li>What is the end goal or state you want people to work towards?</li>
<li>How are you appealing to people's emotions?</li>
<li>How are you making it easy, what is the first step you want people to take?</li>
<li>How are you encouraging people to change? How are you preparing them and equipping them?</li>
<li>What do you want to change about the environment? Will you need new resources or will you use currently available resources in a new way?</li>
<li>How can desired behaviour be made repeatable? Does your success depend on desired behaviour become a habit?</li>
<li>How will you involve other people in the change process? How will you target and grow a base of early adopters?</li>
