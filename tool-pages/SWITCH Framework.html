						<h1>SWITCH Framework</h1>
						
						<p class="time">60-90 Min</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-about">
						<h2>About</h2>
						
						<p>The Switch Framework is widely used to guide behaviour change approaches - especially in the behavior change communication domain. Similar to  the NUDGE framework, it goes beyond complex choices and focuses on what it takes to create sustainable behaviour change. The model proposes that there are three elements of behaviour of a person - the rational side (The Rider), the emotion side ( The Elephant), and the environment (The Path). To change behavior one has to focus all three aspects. </p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>Use Cases</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Identify how a product or service might be able to achieve behaviour change. </li>
<li>Identify how behaviour change may be realised in the use of a product or service.</li>
<li>Identify a communication or advertising strategy for a behavior change initiative. </li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>Limitations</h2>
						
						<p>While the SWITCH model is great in terms of highlighting the different aspects of how  behavior change can be approached, it is upto the designer to define how these aspects will come together in terms of a campaign or program.  </p>

					<h2>Understand</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li> ‘<span>Direct The Rider‘<span>: Behavior change can happen when we provide a crystal clear direction to the rational side (The Rider) of a person who is to adopt a behavior. To be able to appeal to the rational side, one can:</li>
<li>Follow The Bright Spots: Build on existing positive behaviour and success stories rather than focusing all the energy on fixing the problematic areas. Learn from, and scale positives. </li>
<li>Script the Critical Moves: Dissolve the resistance by breaking down the big picture into specific behaviours that people can be asked to focus on. </li>
<li>Point to the Destination: Create a specific clear goal that people can work towards and respond to - something that is inspirational and relevant.</li>
<li>‘<span>Motivate The Elephant‘<span>: It is critical to engage a person's emotion side (The Elephant) to be able to achieve sustainable behavior change. To appeal to people's emotion side, one can:</li>
<li>Find the Feeling: Make people feel something that inspires them to change. Try and focus on positive motivation rather than just negative reinforcement. </li>
<li>Shrink The Change: Break down the change until it no longer seems daunting. Lay a path from a simple first step to long term change in as small steps as possible. </li>
<li>Grow Your People: Identify skills, knowledge, resources, tools, rewards etc. that can help enable behavior change.  </li>
<li>'shape The Path‘<span>: When one changes the  situation/environment/ context (The Path), often it makes it easier for the Rider and Elephant to follow. To be able to create an enabling environment, one can:</li>
<li>Tweak the Environment: Change elements in the physical environment that are current bottlenecks or introduce new elements that can enable desired behavior. </li>
<li>Build Habits:  Look for ways to convert behaviour change into habits by enabling repetition of desired behaviors. </li>
<li>Rally the Herd:  Get change recognised and adopted by other people - it helps build support and momentum.</li>
</ul>

							<h2>Step by Step</h2>

						<ol>
<li><span>Familiarise yourself:</span> Read through the various boxes in the SWITCH template. At the top is where the current behaviour and the desired behavior are to be noted first.</li>
<li><span>Get started:</span> Start with the Rider and map out ideas and thoughts under each of the three sub aspects. Follow the same process for Elephant and Rider. The ideas should be focused on that specific aspect. </li>
<li><span>Refine & Review:</span> See how the different aspects are connected to each other. Refine and review in terms of whether it is realistic to bring all things together. </li>

					<h2>How to for Facilitators</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Start with participants’ existing understanding of the current behaviors being displayed and the  behavior change desired. Move to each section thinking of the rational (Rider), emotional (Elephant), and environment (Path) dimensions of behavior change. </li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants walk you through the worksheet  they have created and probe on what therefore would be a comprehensive strategy that takes into account rationale, emotion, and environment. </li>
</ol>

					<h2>Facilitators Question Bank</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>What is the behaviour change you are focusing on? Why is that your focus?</li>
<li>Are you looking to create behaviour change through your product or service? Or, are you looking to change behaviour with the way people interact with your product or service?</li>
<li>Why do you think it is important to appeal to people's  rational side? How do you want to do it? Are there any bright spots or current positive behavior you can learn from and use? </li>
<li>What specific behaviors do you want people to adopt? Have you broken change down into easy steps? How will you focus on adoption of these specific behaviors?</li>
<li>What is the end goal or state you want people to work towards?</li>
<li>How are you appealing to people's emotion to enable change? How are you making it easy - what is the first step you want people to take?</li>
<li>How are you encouraging people to change? How are you preparing them and equipping them?</li>
<li>What do you want to change about the environment? </li>
<li>Does it require new material and resources or just using what is currently there is a different way?</li>
<li>How can the behavior be repeated? Do you want the behavior to become a habit?</li>
<li>How will you involve other people in the change process?</li>
