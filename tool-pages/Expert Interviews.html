					<div class="tool-about">
						<h2>About</h2>
						
						<p>Experts are consultants, thinkers, practitioners who can give participants a macro understanding of trends and forces at work in the market or ecosystem they aim to penetrate. Expert Interviews should be to the point to make the most of their limited time.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>Use Cases</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Gaining a deep understanding of a given subject matter. This could mean contextualising trends shaping the ecosystem the startup or organisation is hoping to enter or better understanding the needs of users they have the chance to work with in their professional activity.</li>
<li>Getting clarity on specific concerns related to the service or programme being designed (monetisation, legal compliance, scaling).</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>Limitations</h2>
						
						<p>Expert interviews are often meant to be short and concise to be mindful of the interviewee's time. The participants should have carefully chosen and prioritised their questions in case the interview is cut short.</p>

					<h2>Understand</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>The key part of an expert interview is the preparation. The participants should familiarise themselves with the experts</span>’ work prior to interviews and prepare a few ‘<span>Notes on their work or activity</span>’ to refer back to during the interview.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Interview Questions</span>’ should be clear and prioritised so the most important questions can come up earlier in the interview in case the interview is cut short.</li>
</ul>

							<h2>Step by Step</h2>

						<ol>
<li><span>Prepare for the interview:</span> First look into the expert you will be speaking to's activity and writing to build a foundational knowledge of what the discussion will be about.</li>
<li><span>Introduce yourself:</span> Start the interview by introducing yourself and building credibility.</li>
<li><span>Conduct the interview:</span> Go through the questions you have for the expert and take notes (record audio if you have consent).</li>
<li><span>Conclude the interview:</span> At the end of your interview ask the expert if there is anything else they'd like to add or cover on the topic.</li>

					<h2>How to for Facilitators</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Help participants clearly identify the themes or lines of inquiry they‘d like to research.</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Help them formulate questions that can get them the information they need.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants rehearse the questions and test their equipment:</span> microphone or camera if they chose to use any.</li>

					<h2>Facilitators Question Bank</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>What are the main information gaps you‘d like clarity on? Refer to the problem tree and stakeholder mapping if you are not sure where to start.</li>
<li>Who do you plan on speaking to? Why? How and where will you reach them?</li>
<li>How much time will they be able to afford you? Choose a few questions to prioritize accordingly.</li>
<li>Have you read or reviewed their work? Are you questions answered there?</li>
