						<h1>Expert Interviews</h1>
						
						<p class="time">30 Min+</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-about">						
						<p>Experts are academicians, thinkers, professionals, and entrepreneurs who can provide an informed view on the research subject at hand. Experts usually have limited time available, and may on occasions need to be monetarily rewarded for sharing their experiences and expertise. </p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>USE CASES</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Build a foundation understanding of a given subject matter - for example, the nature of an ecosystem, the impact of trends, the needs of users, the impact of technology etc.</li>
<li>Source inputs and clarify specific concerns and opportunities - for example, monetisation strategy, compliance, product-market fit, scaling strategy etc.</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>
						
						<p>Experts often have a strong view on things. It is important to not get totally overawed. Also, there is usually a range of expertise available - researchers have to choose well - experts should have necessary experience and skills to comment on subject. Some experts are ready to assist for a fee which can limit a researcher's ability to engage with them. </p>

					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>The key part of an expert interview is the preparation. The participants should familiarise themselves with the experts</span>’ work prior to interviews and prepare a few ‘<span>Notes on their work or activity</span>’ to refer back to during the interview.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Interview Questions</span>’ should be clear and prioritised so the most important questions can come up earlier in the interview in case the interview is cut short. An expert's point of view should be valued and the person should be made to feel important - researchers should not rush through such conversations (unless experts wish to do so).</li>
<li>In the interviews, go deep into expert input that seems new and insightful - clarify with the intent of learning, and ask follow up questions where required.</li>
<li>Encourage experts to speak of things they are passionate about, but also ensure that the areas you intend to cover are not missed out.</li>
</ul>

							<h2>STEP BY STEP</h2>

						<ol>
<li><span>Prepare for the interview:</span> First, learn about the expert - their professional journey, published papers, lectures etc. to inform the discussion you are about to have. Note important findings on a sheet. Next, take a look at the lines of enquiry and key questions from the plan. Prepare a final list of questions for the expert.</li>
<li><span>Introduce yourself:</span> Start the interview by introducing yourself and building credibility.</li>
<li><span>Conduct the interview:</span> Go through the questions you have for the expert and take notes (record audio if you have recieved consent).</li>
<li><span>Conclude the interview:</span> At the end of your interview ask the expert if there is anything else they'd like to add or cover on the topic.</li>

					<h2><span>HOW TO</span> FOR FACILITATORS</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Help participants clearly identify the themes or lines of inquiry they‘d like to research.</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Check on the profile of experts that teams intend to reach out to. Help teams formulate questions that can get them the information they need from the experts identified.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants rehearse the questions and test their equipment:</span> microphone or camera if they chose to use any.</li>
</ol>
				</div>
				
				<div class="f-question-bank">
					<h2>FACILITATORS QUESTION BANK</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>What are the main information gaps you‘d like clarity on? Refer to the problem tree and stakeholder mapping if you are not sure where to start.</li>
<li>Why do you need to do expert research?</li>
<li>Who are the experts you want to speak to? Why these experts?</li>
<li>How and where will you reach your experts?</li>
<li>Do you have previous experience interviewing experts? Would you like to share any best practices with the group?</li>
<li>How much time will they be able to give to you? How do you want to prioritise questions accordingly?</li>
<li>Have you read or reviewed the experts' works? Are there questions that emerged from that activity?</li>
