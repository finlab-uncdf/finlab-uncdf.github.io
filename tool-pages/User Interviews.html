						<h1>User Interviews</h1>

					<div class="tool-about">						
						<p>Collecting first-hand accounts of experiences, needs and concerns from people can be a great source of inspiration. User interviews are one of the most powerful tools available to researchers. Interviews unlike surveys are meant to be deep open ended conversations. They can be done in context (at users' homes and places of work) or at a neutral location (like a cafe). In context interviews allow researchers to observe users go about their tasks - which can be an additional source of insight. </p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>USE CASES</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Build a deep foundational understanding of the needs, attitudes, and behaviors of target users, stakeholders, service providers </li>
<li>Identify ideas and co-create solutions with users, stakeholders and service providers </li>
<li>Evaluate early concepts and prototypes with users, stakeholders and service providers</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>LIMTATIONS</h2>
						
						<p>User interviews take time and effort to organise, conduct and synthesise. While user interviews provide rich and grounded perspectives, it is not feasible to do large sample interview based studies. The quality of information is more important than the quantity of information while using research methods such as interviews - researchers should be prepared to defend their work in case the quantity question comes up.  </p>

					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>For a smooth interview, an interviewer should prepare a simple Discussion Guide - a repository of questions to be asked in the interview. This will help keep track of the discussion and ensure all the intended topics are covered. Guides should be prepared by looking closely at lines of enquiry and key questions. Experienced researchers may only need brief guides with top level questions. To be safe, a respository of both key questions and follow up queries should be prepared. </li>
<li>The ‘<span>Personal Introduction</span>’ helps set the tone of the interview and establish mutual respect. If the session is to be recorded this is a good time to request consent from the respondent.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Icebreaker</span>’ can simply be a set of questions or an activity that is easy for the participant to complete to get them more comfortable with the interview. These can be simple questions like their age, professional activity, their hobbies or what a typical day looks like for them.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Open-Ended Questions</span>’ should be formulated to help participants open up and share as much as possible about the experience being discussed.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Follow-Up Questions</span>’ help the interviewer better understand the why and the how of a story: Why has a person done what they did? How do they feel about it? Was it confusing? Challenging? Empowering? Such questions will result in the identification of potential pain points to be addressed by the product or service being designed.</li>

							<h2>STEP BY STEP</h2>

						<ol>
<li><span>Introduce yourself:</span> This is the section that helps you start interviews. By clearly establishing credentials and purpose for the research, researchers can establish trust. </li>
<li><span>Break the ice:</span> This part of an interview is about making respondents feel comfortable. Ask a couple of easy/light questions that get respondents into the groove.</li>
<li><span>Ask open-ended questions:</span> The main part of the interview is focused on getting into the shoes of the respondents. Dependent on the topic of research - ask respondents to share stories and specific experiences. Build a conversation. </li>
<li><span>Follow-up questions:</span> Use follow-up questions to dig deeper into specific aspects of things the respondent may be sharing. Get into behaviors in detail, discuss motivations and needs. </li>

					<h2><span>HOW TO</span> FOR FACILITATORS</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Help participants clearly identify the themes or lines of enquiry they‘d like to research.</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Help them formulate questions that can result in insightful discussions.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants practice their questions before going out into the field.</li>

					<h2>FACILITATORS QUESTION BANK</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>What are the main information gaps you‘d like clarity on? Refer to the problem tree and stakeholder mapping if you are not sure where to start.</li>
<li>Who do you plan on speaking to? Why? </li>
<li>How and where will you reach the respondents? Are they known to you or will you have to find a way to recruit?</li>
<li>Are you offering respondents some compensation or reward for their time and input?</li>
<li>How will you introduce the purpose of the interview to respondents?</li>
<li>What are the key questions we want to ask? Are we looking at behaviours, motivations, needs through the questions we are asking?</li>
<li>Are there any sensitive topics in our discussion guide? How can we indirectly approach the topics? Are they necessary?</li>
<li>How long are the interview likely to last? If you have less time available - which questions would you like to focus on?</li>
