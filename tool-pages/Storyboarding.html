						<p>A Storyboard helps visualise a process or service from end-to-end. Inspired by film makers and comics, storyboards help users and stakeholders understand and react to a proposed product or service solution. </p>

						<h2>USE CASES</h2>

<li>Prototype and test product and service experiences.</li>

						<h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>
						
						<p>While Storyboarding is a great way to share what a product or service experience looks like, it can often end up giving users the wrong impression - either lacking the necessary detail, or be so detailed that it confuses the user providing feedback. Visual styles, icons and symbols used have an impact on user feedback - people tend to respond more positively to familiar visuals and patterns. </p>

					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Storyboards are basic visualisations in comic book style that aim to communicate important aspects of a product or service experience.</li>
<li>Designers may choose to create intensive storyboards where multiple visualisations are packed on one sheet of paper, or they may choose to use multiple sheets of paper to depict the different steps of the service journey.</li>
<li>A storyboard is a combination of illustrations, descriptive text, and dialogue (to represent interaction between users and service providers).</li>
<li>A storyboard may focus on the entire end-to-end journey, or just a specific user task / part of the service - for example, opening a new user account, submitting KYC documents, depositing loan payments etc.</li>
<li>Storyboards try and cover not just people interactions but also document objects, environments, and messaging (think POEMS) that make up a complete service experience.</li>
<li>While there is no set number of scenes required, 3-10 frames are a safe target to aim for - 3 for simple stories focused on a key service aspect, and 10 if one is trying to capture the essence of a complete end-to-end experience.</li>
</ul>

							<h2>STEP BY STEP</h2>
						</div>
						
						<ol>
<li><span>Outline the key steps:</span> Start by discussing as a team the key stages, user actions and interactions along the experience journey.</li>
<li><span>Visualise the touchpoints:</span> Break the experience down into key interactions that can be depicted as scenes or frames. In each scene, clearly convey how the service is being provided in writing and through simple illustrations. Show any devices, people or spaces necessary to tell the story.</li>
<li><span>Test & Refine:</span> Test storyboards with different users, and record points of improvement.</li>

					<h2><span>HOW TO</span> FOR FACILITATORS</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure the team has a clear understanding of the key steps of their service.</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Help teams Prioritise aspects of their service to visualise. Help them create clear and complete scenes - while not wasting time on unnecessary detail.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span>  Have participants present the storyboards to another group and refine their scenes based on feedback. If they are taking storyboards to users for testing, help them prepare for the test. Once the testing is over, discuss learnings and refinement.</li>

					<h2>FACILITATORS QUESTION BANK</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Are you going to creating storyboards for the entire journey? Or a select part of the journey?</li>
<li>Are the storyboards simple enough to understand? Do you want to add descriptions under each scene?</li>
<li>How are you capturing objects, environments, and messaging that might be part of the service?</li>
<li>Have you clearly shown the various phases and touchpoints the experience is built upon?</li>
<li>How do you plan to test the storyboards? Who will you test them with?</li>
