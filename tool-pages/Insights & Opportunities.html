						<h2>About</h2>
						
						<p>The most challenging part of sensemaking is drawing insights from one's research. Insights and Opportunities are two ways of concisely capturing the information to take forward from the research into the design of the service being created.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>Use Cases</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Making sense of the research.</li>
<li>Making the research easier to understand for other team members who were not part of the research. </li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>Limitations</h2>
						
						<p>This activity requires time to think through the research and might take several rounds of refinement.</p>

					<h2>Understand</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>The purpose of this activity is to translate findings or ‘<span>Key Takeaways</span>’ into consolidated ‘<span>Insights</span>’ and ‘<span>Opportunities</span>’. To do so, the team will pull from their affinity mapping exercise to identify valuable takeaways. Those will be written in the ‘<span>Key Takeaways</span>’ box.</li>
<li>Related takeaways might then form a new understanding of the context at hand or of the user's needs. These should be captured as ‘<span>Insights</span>’. There are two parts to an insight, a support statement which explains how the team's findings inform a new understanding of the context at hand by bringing together in a single sentence the situation observed, the challenges faced by the users and the user's perspective on the matter. Together they should represent a new understanding the team has derived from those. This support statement can then be summarised into a crisper statement that will become the insight statement.</li>
<li>Insights are by definition intended to be enlightening, however they can be challenging to translate into ‘<span>Opportunities</span>’. A simple way to overcome this challenge is to frame the interesting parts of the insights as “How might we” statements. In doing so, the team learns to unpack a given insight into several possible solutions to explore.</li>

							<h2>Step by Step</h2>
						</div>
						
						<ol>
<li><span>Identify takeaways:</span> With the team, refer back to the Affinity Mapping or similar synthesis exercise conducted prior to this and identify all the valuable, interesting, surprising observations, facts or anecdotes from the research.</li>
<li><span>Reflect on takeaways:</span> Discuss as a team what about the Takeaways is insightful? What new perspectives do those reveal? How do they inform the team's understanding? Group the observations that point to a similar insight.</li>
<li><span>Translate into Insights:</span> Insights can feel very ambiguous, it is important to leave time to find ways to clearly formulate what the research will inform the next steps of the process by translating them into insights.</li>
<li><span>Expand into Opportunities:</span> In order to ease the transition into problem solving, How Might We statements can be used to identify possible strategies or objectives to strive for.</li>

					<h2>How to for Facilitators</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Have everyone spend time discussing which parts of the research were most surprising or interesting. </li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Help the participants translate their findings and takeaways into insights and then opportunities.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants discuss if they find the opportunity spaces reflective of the research and inspiring enough to move forward with.</li>

					<h2>Facilitators Question Bank</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>What have you learned from your research?</li>
<li>Can you formulate a couple insight statements for each thematic cluster on your Affinity Map?</li>
<li>Are there any ideas that already come to mind? If so, how can you translate them into How Might We statements?</li>
<li>Is there anything you found to be valuable information earlier in the research that isn‘t represented in your insight statements?</li>
