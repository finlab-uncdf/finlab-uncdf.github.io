					<div class="tool-about">
						
						<p>Personas are one of the most important tools within the world of user-centered design. They are fictional “characters” that represent a type of user or stakeholder for whom a solution has to be developed. A Persona is not a single demographic segment of users, but instead a representation of a certain type of needs, behaviours, and motivations - that may be reflected by multiple people across demographic segments. Instead of designing for anonymous user segments - Personas help focus on real people and needs. </p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>USE CASES</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Document critical needs, behaviors and motivations of target users and stakeholders.</li>
<li>Humanise target users and stakeholders as representative profiles.</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>
						
						<p>Codifying a Persona is dependent on the nature of the understanding of user needs, behaviors and motivations. Quality and range of research respondents directly impacts the kind of Personas a team is able to define - whether they are relevant, logical, specific, recognisable, and targettable.</p>

					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>The ‘<span>Name</span>’ and ‘<span>Relevant Demographics</span>’ section is to be filled with basic details of the target user, such as Age, Gender, Income, Family Size, Occupation.</li>
<li>‘<span>About</span>’ helps add context to the Persona - humanizing the profile as a believable, relatable individual.</li>
<li>‘<span>Broad Goals</span>’ are the key aspirations and motivations that describe the Persona's view on life overall, or on a specific aspect of life that is relevant to design (for example - goals relevant to financials planning and investment in life).</li>
<li>‘<span>Specific Needs/Problems</span>’ are the needs of the Persona - specific to the problem or opportunity being designed for.</li>
<li>‘<span>Specific Behaviors</span>’ are current actions that best describe the way the Persona engages with the problem or opportunity.</li>
<li>‘<span>Specific Motivators</span>’ are the key attitudes that drive the way the Persona engages with the problem or opportunity.</li>
<li>‘<span>Specific Pain Points</span>’ are the key issues and challenges that the Persona wants to avoid with engaging with the problem or opportunity.</li>
<li>‘<span>Quotes</span>’ are specific statements made by respondents during User Interviews or Focus Group Discussions - they best capture the essence of the Persona.</li>

							<h2>STEP BY STEP</h2>
						</div>
						
						<ol>
<li><span>Find patterns:</span> Based on research data, identify patterns emerging with regards to types of users. Types could be based on factors such as - the most common, most challenging, most accesible, most experimental etc.</li>
<li><span>Define Persona:</span> For a chosen type of user, provide the information required. For specific behaviors, motivators, and pain points - base these on actual data collected during research.</li>
<li><span>Illustrate Persona:</span> Visualize the type as a single individual that becomes the face and voice of that user type. Visualization are important to humanize the user. It is compleltely fine for visuals to not be perfect.</li>
<li><span>Build More Personas:</span> Personas can be created for as many user types as the team feels necessary to consider for design.</li>

					<h2><span>HOW TO</span> FOR FACILITATORS</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure participants understand the exercise and guide them through the activity with examples.</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Discuss the user types chosen by teams to convert into Personas. Help them choose relevant and powerful data points for each section of the tool.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have the participants walk you through their Personas, and discuss learnings from the exercise. Help teams see gaps and ways to improve their Personas.</li>

					<h2>FACILITATORS QUESTION BANK</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Do you see any big patterns emerging as clear types of users?</li>
<li>What are these types? How will you prioritize what Personas to build?</li>
<li>Do you have enough information for chosen Personas?</li>
<li>Do the types have specific enough needs and behaviors?</li>
<li>Do the Personas have significantly different motivations and painpoints?</li>
<li>Which do you think is the most important Persona to design for?</li>
<li>Are there any specific quotes from the research you‘d like to highlight?</li>
<li>Along with the insights, what are the Personas telling you? How are Personas connected to the insights?</li>
