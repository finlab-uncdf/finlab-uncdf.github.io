					<div class="tool-about">
						
						<p>Affinity Mapping is a synthesis tool aimed at identifying insights from qualitative research observations and findings. It involves organizing key data points into clusters (called Affinities) that are logical, thematic, and consistent, and then discussing the clusters to the point that clear learnings and insights emerge.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>USE CASES</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Structure the team's thinking on the topic being researched.</li>
<li>Organise research findings into buckets of information and themes that make sense</li>
<li>Translate themes of information into learnings</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>
						
						<p>While Affinity Mapping is a great way to look for patterns and insights, it can be an exhausting exercise - what observations and data points to consider?, are the clusters distinct enough?, how macro or micro should the clusters be?, what is the relationship between clusters etc. are all questions that can lead to confusion and inconclusive debate. It is important for the team to look at the exercise as something that requires iteration.</p>

					<h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TOOL</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Information for this exercise should be sourced from either secondary or primary research activities the team has conducted.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Observation</span>’, ‘<span>Quote</span>’, </span>’Data</span>’, </span>’Facts</span>’ are the kinds of information that be used by the team. Mentioning the source of the data (for example - the particular respondent, a blog, a particular expert, a particular train station etc.) adds credibility to the notes shared.</li>
<li>Any information should be written down on a sticky note and added to the wall. Each note should be complete - not too short nor wordy. One data point per sticky note.</li>
<li>Sticky notes when added to the wall have to be parked in groups or clusters based on a common theme.</li>
<li>‘<span>Themes</span>’ start emerging as grouping of similar or complementary information starts taking place. There is no one set rule for identifying a theme - it is a matter of making sure each theme is complete in itself - it makes conceptual, logical, and emotional sense.</li>
<li>If there are close connections or interdependencies between themes - describing that relationship is important at this stage.</li>
<li>Moving forward from the themes, a team is meant to discuss and draw learnings and insights through a process of iterative synthesis - asking where the themes emerge from? What do the themes mean? And why are they important?</li>
</ul>

							<h2>STEP BY STEP</h2>
						</div>
						
						<ol>
<li><span>Review the research:</span> Ask team members to review the data collected during the research, and use sticky notes to document interesting points - critical observations, quotes from users, data and facts, and even early learnings. One data point per sticky note.</li>
<li><span>Place, discuss, group:</span> Each person should then describe each of their notes to the others and start adding them to the wall. As related points come up, the team should start forming clusters - group the notes based on similar or complementary data points.</li>
<li><span>Unpack clusters:</span> If at any point there seem to be multiple number of themes emerging under one cluster - the cluster should be broken down into smaller clusters.</li>
<li><span>Review wall:</span> Review the clusters with the group, make sure everyone relates with the themes, and check if anything is missing.</li>
<li><span>Discuss Learnings:</span> Discuss what each of the themes mean in terms of learnings and insights.</li>
</ol>

					<h2><span>HOW TO</span> FOR FACILITATORS</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Have everyone spend time silently going over their research notes and write down valuable information on sticky notes.</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Help the participants form clusters, feel free to make suggestions for new clusters or ask if some can be broken down further.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants present to other groups. Discuss how each team has structured their maps, and what teams could learn from each other.</li>
</ol>
				</div>
				
				<div class="f-question-bank">
					<h2>FACILITATORS QUESTION BANK</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Have the teams made a note of their key data points on sticky notes? Have you provided sources for at least the key ones?</li>
<li>Who will start in each team? How will you keep a check on what themes are emerging?</li>
<li>What clusters are starting to emerge? Can the team walk me through them?</li>
<li>Should any cluster be broken down further?</li>
<li>Has anything come up that felt new, surprising, refreshing? If so make a note of it - consider using sticky notes of a different color.</li>
<li>Are there things that can sit under two or more themes? Are they represented in both clusters?</li>
<li>What are the most important themes that have emerged?</li>
<li>What do your themes mean for you? What are some of your key learnings and insights?</li>
