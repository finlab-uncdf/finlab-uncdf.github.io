					<div class="tool-about">
						<h2>About</h2>
						
						<p>Affinity Mapping is a synthesis tool aimed at identifying patterns in the research observations and findings by clustering
group observations and research data into logical, thematic categories of learning and insight.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>Use Cases</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Structuring the team's thinking on a given topic being researched.</li>
<li>Organising the research findings into distinct opportunity areas.</li>
<li>Discussing the research and how the experiences varied from one respondent to the next. </li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>Limitations</h2>
						
						<p>This is a great way to take a first stab at organising insights from the research however it can be difficult to be exhaustive. If the opportunity clusters that emerge don‘t feel tangible enough, consider trying a couple other methods to look at the data from a new angle. </p>

					<h2>Understand</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>The ‘<span>Observation‘<span>, ‘<span>Quote‘<span>, ‘<span>Takeway</span>’ should all be parts of the secondary and primary research the team has conducted. Any valuable information should be written down on a sticky note and added to the wall.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Themes</span>’ will emerge from grouping similar takeaways or observations together. There is no set rule to identify a theme, rather it is a matter of making sure each theme cluster concisely captures an aspect of the given experience.</li>

							<h2>Step by Step</h2>

						<ol>
<li><span>Review the research:</span> Ask your team members to silently note down observations, quotes and other relevant data points from your respective research activities onto separate sticky notes.</li>
<li><span>Place, discuss, group:</span> Each person should then describe each of their notes to the others and start adding them to the wall. As related points come up start forming clusters.</li>
<li><span>Unpack clusters:</span> If at any point there seem to be multiple themes in one cluster the cluster should be broken down into smaller themes. </li>
<li><span>Review wall:</span> Before wrapping up, review the clusters with the group, make sure everyone understands what they mean and check if anything is missing.</li>

					<h2>How to for Facilitators</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Have everyone spend time silently going over their research notes and write down valuable information on sticky notes. </li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Help the participants form clusters, feel free to make suggestions for new clusters or ask if some can be broken down further.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants present to other groups how they‘ve structured their own map.</li>
</ol>

					<h2>Facilitators Question Bank</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>You brought up [observation], where might that fit onto the map?</li>
<li>What clusters do we have so far? Can you walk me through them?</li>
<li>Should any cluster be broken down further? How about this one?</li>
<li>Has anything come up that felt new, surprising, refreshing? If so call it out on your map by circling it.</li>
<li>Are there things that can sit under two or more themes? That's fine, make sure they are represented in both clusters.</li>
<li>What are the most important themes to surface so far?</li>
