						<h2>About</h2>
						
						<p>The Research Plan is crucial to successful  research. It makes sure the team is aligned on the learning objectives and the research methods to be used. By visually plotting out the research phases along with the lines of inquiry, anyone in the team can understand the plan, and can contribute if needed. </p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>Use Cases</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Defining lines of inquiry for research.</li>
<li>Planning out research activities to be used.</li>
<li>Assigning role and responsibilities when going into research.</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>Limitations</h2>
						
						<p>Creating a Research Plan can help build consensus but can also feel a little overwhelming, the participants should make sure they are being realistic about what can be achieved.</p>

					<h2>Understand</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>The ‘<span>Research Methods</span>’ is the section where the participants decide upon the research approach needed to find out more information about a particular line inquiry. Different methods such as Secondary Research, Primary Research, User Interviews, amongst others can be used. The research methods selected should take into account the nature of information needed and those who can provide it. </li>
<li>The ‘<span>Key lines of Inquiry</span>’ are derived from the Foundation phase, where tools such as the Problem Tree+5 Whys and the Stakeholder Map can highlight information gaps, or potential areas of research.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Key Questions</span>’ refer to 2-3 questions (per line of inquiry) the team would like to ask questions on or find answers to in their secondary research.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Research Tools</span>’ box should cover any tool or template to be used during research activities.  For example, using a Stakeholder Mapping exercise during user or expert interviews can help consolidate the team</span>’s understanding of the matter.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Research Participants</span>’ box is specifically for User and Expert Research methods. The group should use this box to discuss who might be good to speak to and who can easily be recruited within the given timeframe.</li>
<li>‘<span>Person Responsible</span>’ is meant to highlight the various roles and responsibilities. Since research can be a demanding and time consuming task, the teams should carefully divy up the work.</li>

<li><span>Define lines of inquiry:</span> List down the gaps in the research and the things which need to be researched further from the Problem Tree and Stakeholder Map, and list them down to the corresponding research methodology.</li>
<li><span>Add details:</span> Add more detail and structure to the research plan, by adding relevant details such as tools, participants, and people/teams responsible.</li>

					<h2>How to for Facilitators</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Explain the activity to the participants, if participants are feeling stuck, help them by filling out a row with them.</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Make sure that they refer to the previous tools to include lines of inquiry or knowledge gaps that they had previously identified.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have the participants share their plan and see if they have assigned the research methods that seem relevant to the lines of inquiry and that the participants feel comfortable using.</li>

					<h2>Facilitators Question Bank</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Are all the information gaps from the Foundation stage being addressed in the research plan?</li>
<li>Is the plan realistic? Will the team be able to successfully complete all the research tasks?</li>
<li>How are we planning to distribute responsibilities? Are we comfortable with what is on the template?</li>
<li>What is our documentation strategy? Are we going to be noting our learnings at the end of the day? Are you planning to record interviews? Where will you collect your notes from your readings?</li>
