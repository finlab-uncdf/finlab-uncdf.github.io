						<h1>Card Sorting</h1>
						
						<p class="time">20 Min</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-about">
						<h2>About</h2>
						
						<p>Card Sorting is a research activity in which respondents are presented with visual or written cues on cards that represent a certain product, service or system features and then are asked to group, prioritise or sort the cards as a way of getting insight into their mental model. </p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>Use Cases</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Engaging research participants in an active, visual manner.</li>
<li>Understanding mental models and associations respondents might make.</li>
<li>Understanding tradeoffs respondents are willing to make when having to choose between different solutions.</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>Limitations</h2>
						
						<p>Any card sort with more than 20-30 cards risks overwhelming the user and should be avoided. Also, the user will only react to cards available - the onus is on the researcher to create a robust set of cards that represent reasonable breadth and depth.</p>

					<ul>
<li>The ‘<span>Category/Level/Preference/Stage</span>’ is the section where the researcher needs to decide what is being mapped. Is it preference (for example - out of multiple features on an online commerce site - what is prefered?), sequence (for example - what should be on the home page and what should follow?), or just a matter of simple categorisation (for example - these features represent the known and these are new)? The categories can be defined by the researcher (closed sort) or left to the user (open sort). It is ideal to start with defined categories.   </li>
<li>‘<span>Attributes/Topics/Events</span>’ are the content factors that are used to populate the cards. These are ideally represented by visuals and supporting descriptions. Sometimes researchers also use cards that are just text based (adjectives, verbs, emotions etc.). The researcher has the option of creating multiple versions (for example - multiple login screen options) of a card in case the idea is to capture preference. </li>
<li>The researcher is responsible for setting the context and then letting the respondent move forward with the exercise. As the card sorting is taking place, the researcher can ask questions and engage in conversation. For this, the researcher must be confident of why individual cards are part of the bundle - what they represent and what their sorting in particular categories could mean in terms of insights. </li>
<li>The exercise can be used as a tool for exploration or for definition and decision making. Although it is better suited as for exploration and needs to be supported with more in-depth conversations. </li>
<li>The exercise can be done with individual research respondents or in a group. </li>

<li><span>Cleary brief the respondent:</span> It’s important that the categories be absolutely clear. Also the attributes, topics, events, should not be ambiguous either.</li>
<li><span>Sort and discuss:</span> Research respondents should either discuss their sorting as they are doing it - or talk over it once it's done.</li>
<li><span>Identify misfit cards:</span> If it is felt the cards don’t fit into any particular category - then keep them aside and come back to them later.</li>

					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure the participants understand the flow of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck). </li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Help the teams create the cards and plan the discussion with the research participants.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants explain how the session played out, and the responses from the discussion.</li>

<li>What do you want to learn from this activity?</li>
<li>Do you know what categories, levels, preferences. stages you want to get respondents to sort the cards in? Do you want to allow them to create their own categories?</li>
<li>How are you going to make the cards coherent? What visuals and descriptors are you planning to use?</li>
<li>How many cards are you planning to create? Are all of them essential? Which are the most important?</li>
<li>Do you have a follow-up questions you want to ask the respondents? </li>
<li>Have you rehearsed this in your group as an activity?</li>
