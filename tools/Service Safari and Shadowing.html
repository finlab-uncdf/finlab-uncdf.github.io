					<div class="tool-about">
						<h2>About</h2>
						
						<p>The Service Safari activity allows participants to step into the shoes of the user and to go through the experience themselves. By experiencing the various steps of the journey, the team can understand the joys and pain points in the user experience of using a product or service. Shadowing is similar but involves following someone as they go through an experience rather than the researcher doing it themselves.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>Use Cases</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Better understanding a user’s pain points of going through an experience or service.</li>
<li>Identifying the various steps or process involved in a given experience or service.</li>
<li>Learning about possible workarounds and hacks users have developed to suit their needs.</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>Limitations</h2>
						
						<p>It is important to be remain judgement-free and respectful of others’ behaviors when conducting such activities so that respondents or participants will feel comfortable and share more openly how the engage with a given service. </p>

					<h2>Understand</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>The ‘<span>Details</span>’ column has questions or prompts  such as ‘<span>What did you do?</span>’ or ‘<span>What did you like?</span>’ which help add more detail and definition to the experience.</li>
<li>Make sure all steps of the journey are defined in the format ‘<span>Step 1</span>’, ‘<span>Step 2</span>’, ‘<span>Step 3</span>’ etc., so that it is easier to map the observations of the entire journey.</li>
<li>Marking out the negatives, positives and feedback through the journey can help identify areas for improvement or change. </li>

<li><span>At the start:</span> Explain the activity to the participants and that they should write down any observations that they spot on the go.</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> If present with the participants in the field, encourage them to look for unexpected details that might miss.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants share their observations and ask them to highlight what they found to be the most interesting or surprising.</li>
