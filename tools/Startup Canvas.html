						<h1>Startup Canvas</h1>
						
						<p class="time">90-120 Min</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-about">
						<h2>About</h2>
						
						<p>The canvas summarises the most important elements of an organisation’s business model and is especially useful for early stage startups. The version of the canvas being used here is inspired by the Lean methodology and business model canvas.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>Use Cases</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Investigating and mapping how ideas or solutions could be transformed into a holistic business model. </li>
<li>Mapping current business models, identifying gaps and opportunities (priorities), and outlining  interdependencies. </li>
<li>Using the canvas as a dashboard to document each stage of evolution of the business model, and reflecting on investments and results.</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>Limitations</h2>
						
						<p>The canvas tool is not a problem solving tool as such. It has limited capacity to answer what the ‘right’ model for a business is. It is best used as an evolving summary or dashboard. </p>

					<h2>Understand</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>The ‘<span>Problem</span>’ section is to be used to highlight the core problems that users face and that the startup is attempting to solve, not those that the startup is facing as an organisation. </li>
<li>‘<span>Customer Segments</span>’ requires the startup to identify the specific profile of the users for whom the problem is most acutely felt. Profiles can be very specific and also quantised in terms of segments/market size. </li>
<li>‘<span>Solution</span>’ is how the startup plans to address the problem - it could be a product, service, system or a combination of them. </li>
<li>‘<span>Unfair Advantage</span>’ is the distinct, hard to copy competitive advantage the startup enjoys. </li>
<li>‘<span>Unique Value Proposition</span>’ is the core compelling message for the user that communicates the value the startup is creating for them. </li>
<li>‘<span>Channels</span>’ are the ways in which the user will interact with the solution. These could include ways that users will become of the solution, experience it for the first time, purchase and continue to use. </li>
<li>‘<span>Key Metrics</span>’ are the ways the business can measure its success. These could include impressions, downloads, sign ups, transactions, value of transactions, renewals etc. </li>
<li>‘<span>Cost Structure</span>’ is the way the costs are distributed between fixed and variable, and capital investments and operational costs. </li>
<li>‘<span>Revenue Streams</span>’ are the ways in which revenue is to be generated - whether its one time, subscription, loyalty fees etc.</li>

							<h2>Step by Step</h2>

						<ol>
<li><span>Familiarise yourself:</span> Read through the various boxes in the Startup Canvas, you’ll notice the left two columns have to do with internal activity and the two to the right refer to external forces.</li>
<li><span>Get started:</span> As a business, what do you have most clarity on? Is it your understanding of your customer segment or of the needs your are addressing through your business? Use these questions to decide which side of the canvas to start on.</li>
<li><span>Complete:</span> Go through each box and fill out as much as you can. It is completely fine not to know the answer to specific areas.</li>
<li><span>Identify Knowledge Gaps:</span> Once the worksheet is completed to the best your knowledge, jot down in a different color remaining knowledge gaps. Do you have clear revenue streams? Do you have strong metrics to track your progress?</li>

					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Start with participants’ existing knowledge of their business to create a first version of the model. Encourage the participants to highlight any component the participants don’t know the answer to for later reference. </li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants walk you through the canvas they have created and probe on what is their core strengths and weaknesses they would like to build upon. </li>

					<h2>Facilitators Question Bank</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Which part of the business do you have the best view on? What are you least informed on?</li>
<li>Is there anything in here you’d like to understand better? Eg. customer segment, value proposition, etc. </li>
<li>Do you expect your fundamental model and this canvas to change in the next 6 months?</li>
<li>Can you think of any other things you’d like to add to this canvas? Are there any links between boxes you’d like to call out?</li>
<li>Did challenges shared as part of the startup journey resonate with you? Which did you think was most relevant for your company?</li>
<li>What are your company’s goals in the next 3-6-12 months? Are you considering them as you map your priorities?</li>
<li>How do you know something is a priority? Is there understanding within your company that these are the top priorities and challenges, or is there some assumption involved?</li>
<li>Do your priorities depend on each other? Are there 1-2 core priorities at the root of all the different challenges you might be facing?</li>
