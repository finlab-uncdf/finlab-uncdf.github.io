					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>Use Cases</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Building consensus around the ideas to take forward into prototyping. </li>
<li>To ensure that ideas are compared from several angles.</li>

					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>Limitations</h2>
						
						<p>The questions and considerations should be carefully selected to make sure they cover all of the team's concerns regarding the challenge at hand.</p>

<li>The requirements in the template are recommendations, any of these can be edited or removed.</li>
<li>'It solves for the problem or opportunity' should assess how well the solution in question is addressing the challenge defined in previous discussions.</li>
<li>'It reflects the  insights and learnings' should assess how well the solution draws from the findings of the research.</li>
<li>'Users will find it desirable' building on the research and persona profiles, the team should assess how relevant and desirable the concept is.</li>
<li>'The team is excited about it' often overlooked, being able to rally a team around a project is key to its success.</li>
<li></li>
<li>An alternative can be to use a simpler 2x2 comparing Urgency and Importance (the axes can always be adapted to the participants' priorities or discussion).</li>

						<ol>
<li><span>Define the criteria points:</span> Ensure the team agrees on the prioritisation criteria. Edit according to the discussion.</li>
<li><span>Downselect ideas:</span> Choose as a team which ideass to vote on or prioritise. The concepts being voted on should be representative of the various opportunities identified and be diffrent enough from each other to be considered as separate initiatives.</li>
<li><span>Vote on the ideas:</span> Assign values (1-5 or Low, Medium, High) to each idea then tally the votes.</li>
<li><span>Rank and review the ideas:</span> Tally the votes and see which ideas rise to the surface. See if the ranking that emerges properly reflects how the group feels about the ideas.</li>

<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure the participants have reviewed the questions and agree with them. </li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Have the participants agree on how they plan to rate the ideas (number value 1-10? Low, Medium High?).</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants tally the scores for each idea and help build consensus.</li>

					<h2>Facilitators Question Bank</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Do the criteria points in the first column work for us? Should we add or remove any?</li>
<li>Will we be able to score the ideas according to these criteria points? Should we use high-medium-low (highest moves forward)  or should we score out of 10? </li>
<li>How do these scores look to us? Do we agree with this prioritisation? Do we have consensus?</li>
<li>Is there one idea we are excited about taking into prototyping that didn't score the highest?</li>
