						<h2>About</h2>
						
						<p>Theory of Change (TOC) is a framework that attempts to map how desired change is being achieved through intended  activities and investments. It also helps participants differentiate between results and impact. The framework is useful in calibrating strategy - especially in the social impact and development sector.  </p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>Use Cases</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Creating an end to end summary of the intended impact strategy of a programme or business when conceptualising it. </li>
<li>Diagnosing and reflecting on actual impact and to finetune a strategy. In the world of impact investing, the TOC is used to understand how innovators may create greater impact via the investments they may be seeking. </li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>Limitations</h2>
						
						<p>While the TOC helps layout an overall strategy, there is little guarantee that activities and resources will eventually translate into impact on ground. TOCs are often revisited and refined as results from the real world emerge.</p>

					<ul>
<li>The ‘<span>Resources & Inputs</span>’ section is to meant to park the human, knowledge, skill,  financial, technological, infrastructural, systemic capabilities that are required by an innovator or entrepreneur as they look to create impact. </li>
<li>‘<span>Activities</span>’ are those tasks that the resources will help undertake. The nature of these tasks could be both user facing (awareness building, onboarding, servicing etc.) and internal (process development, skill building, hiring, technology adoption etc.) - although the former is of higher priority. Investors needs to be clear that the resources are being spent on priority activities.   </li>
<li>‘<span>Outputs</span>’ are the most basic numbers and metrics that will help measure the quantity of results from the investment into resources and activities. Without going into whether the efforts were successful or not, the outputs help understand the extent of effort (for example - number of people reached, campaigns undertaken, number of learning sessions held etc.)  </li>
<li>‘<span>Outcomes</span>’ are deeper metrics than outputs and start focusing on both the quantity and quality of results. The focus is most importantly on short-medium term impact metrics (for example - number and type of conversions from those reached, level of awareness in people because of campaign, skills built in people because of learning sessions etc.) </li>
<li>‘<span>Impact</span>’ focuses on longer term results and change. The section focuses on real, lasting impact created by the interventions. The meaningfulness of the outcomes and outputs is really brought to fore here (for example - conversions influencing behaviour, awareness leading to better decision making and choice, skills leading to ability to sustain financially etc.)</li>
<li>‘<span>Assumptions</span>’ are risk factors that the innovator is not quite sure of as the TOC is being built. They need to be validated as the TOC is iterated on.</li>

							<h2>Step by Step</h2>

						<ol>
<li><span>Define a vision:</span> Discuss with the team what the intended impact of the program or service should be.</li>
<li><span>Unpack the necessary resources:</span> First fill in the left side of the tool to establish the basic financial, staff, staff and network resources needed to roll out the programme.</li>
<li><span>Link the efforts to the impact:</span> Then link these resources and activities to outputs and outcomes that will lead to the impact you defined in the first step.</li>
<li><span>Identify blindspots:</span> Before ending the session, review the template and look for assumptions you might be making about each step or how they link to each other.</li>

					<h2>How to for Facilitators</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck). </li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Start with participants’ existing knowledge of their activity to create a first version of the map.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants walk you through the map, step by step to spot any gaps or mistakes. </li>

					<h2>Facilitators Question Bank</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>What are the key resources and capabilities that you need to need to access?</li>
<li>What are the resources you have currently? What require additional investments?</li>
<li>What activities are your focus as of now? What resources do you need for these activities? What will these activities help you achieve?</li>
<li>What are the first level of results or outputs that the resources and activities will let you achieve?</li>
<li>How are you differentiating between outputs and outcomes? Are you clear on how outputs will translate into outcomes? </li>
<li>Are your outcomes purely quantitative? What is the qualitative element in them? And vice versa.</li>
<li>Are you being able to differentiate between short-medium term and long term impact?</li>
<li>What does long term impact mean to you? Is it clear or do you feel that it is too abstract at this stage? </li>
<li>What kind of impact did you have in mind when you started working on the program or startup? Is that being reflected here?</li>
<li>Do the desired impact and the resources available match up? Are you sure you are being realistic in your estimation?</li>
<li>What are the key assumptions for you at each stage? Why are these your assumptions? What can you do to minimise these assumptions?</li>
