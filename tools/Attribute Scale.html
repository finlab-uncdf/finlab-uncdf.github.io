						<h2>About</h2>
						
						<p>Attribute Scale  is a method  that helps measure and compare peoples’ needs, attitudes and experiences about products, services, experiences, concepts etc. The method uses a set of scales for measurement defined by two opposite ends, such as for service presence - “physical” and “digital,” for price  “affordable” and “premium,” for brand communication “subtle” and “loud” etc. Different people’s preferences are mapped and then compared. Patterns of are analyzed for insights and opportunities.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>Use Cases</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Map the experience of current users with regards to different product or service attributes and compare.</li>
<li>Map attitudes and needs of potential users with regards to attributes of a future product or service. </li>
<li>Inform the build of personas and profiles.</li>
<li>Map the qualities of competitors / other market players on attribute scale.</li>

                        </ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>Limitations</h2>
						
						<p>The Attribute Scale is useful when teams have a robust sense of the comparison that they plan to map, and also have a consensus on how scores on each attribute are decided. It should be as objective a decision as possible. </p>

					<h2>Understand</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Attributes are the key qualities/ features/ propositions/needs towards which the preference or inclination of the entities (users, competitors, products etc.) need to be mapped - purchasing power,  pricing needs, communication frequency, digitisation, influence, size, convenience, ease of use etc. are some examples of such attributes. </li>
<li>Scale is the way to measure the preference or inclination of these attributes. Typically these can be represented by two extremes points (low-high). Another way to express the extremes is in terms of opposites (for example - physical or digital).</li>
<li>Entities are the things or people that need to be compared. These could be users (young, middle age, old customers), competitors (small companies, established companies), products, services, systems, geographies etc. Comparison between the entities helps the designer arrive at patterns and insights.</li>
<li>Scores are essentially the point on an attribute scale that is deemed to be appropriately representing a particular entity. </li>
<li>Score lines are the lines connecting the different scores on the scales - creating a visual path/representation that can be used for comparison between one entity and another. </li>
<li>Patterns are the visual  commonalities or divergences that emerge once the mapping of scores and score lines has been completed. </li>

						<ol>
<li><span>Familiarise yourself:</span> Read through the various sections in the Attribute Scale template.  Decide what the tool is being used for - profile building, competitor benchmark etc.</li>
<li><span>Attributes, Scale & Entities:</span> Make a list of attributes that are the most important to map. Decide what scale extremes are relevant for each of the attributes. Next decide on the entities that need to be mapped on the scale. </li>
<li><span>Map Scores:</span> Go attribute by attribute and map each entity on the scales defined. Connect scores on each attribute to create a visual mapping. </li>
<li><span>Review Patterns & Discuss:</span> Review the patterns that are emerging across the different entities and discuss how they inform the insights.</li>

					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Start with a discussion on what attributes need to be mapped, and which entities need to be compared. Ask the teams to also define the scales for each attributes. Guide them while they map and question on how they have arrived at these scores. </li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants walk you through the worksheet they have filled out and probe them on their mapping of the attributes and what it means in terms of patterns and insights. </li>

					<h2>Facilitators Question Bank</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>What are we looking to map during this exercise? Are we clear on the attributes and the entities? Are your scales under each attribute well defined? </li>
<li>Are your entities people / users or are these competitors/organisations/services? </li>
<li>What will this attribute mapping help you achieve?</li>
<li>Does each team member want to map for each entity? Or, do you want to first arrive at a consensus and then map?</li>
<li>Can you see patterns emerging visually as you are going through the mapping?</li>
<li>How will the patterns help you create personas and profile if that is what you were looking for?</li>
<li>How has the comparison create clarity for the team?</li>
