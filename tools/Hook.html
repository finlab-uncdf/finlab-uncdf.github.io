						<h2>About</h2>
						
						<p>The Hook Model is a tool used to encourage habitual use of products, services and systems by users. It is based on the hypothesis that habitual use is realised if users are taken through a cyclical journey that includes - triggers (things that get the user to come to the product/service), actions (the interaction of user with the product/service), rewards (the benefits for the user upon use), and investment (the commitment realised  by use of product/service over time). </p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>Use Cases</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Identify a strategy to encourage users to come back to a product or service after they have used it for the first time.</li>
<li></li>
<li>Identify a strategy to encourage users to keep using  a product or service over time. </li>
<li></li>
<li>Identify a strategy to encourage habits and repeated behavior  in any context. </li>
<li></li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>Limitations</h2>
						
						<p>The HOOK model was developed based on learnings of user behavior on online platforms and social networking sites. It therefore may seem sometimes come across as a limited framework n cases where technology may not be involved.

					<h2>Understand</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Triggers:' Things that get users to interact with and use a product/service for the first time, and then keep coming back  over time. There are two major types of triggers - external and internal. </li>
<li>'External Triggers:' Triggers that are focused on marketing and advertising vehicles that bring users on board. The main types being:</li>
<li>Paid Triggers: Advertising, search engine marketing, and other paid channels are commonly used to get users</span>’ attention and prompt them to act. Paid triggers can be effective but costly ways to keep users coming back.</li>
<li>Earned Triggers: Earned triggers are free in that they cannot be bought directly, but they often require investment in the form of time spend on public and media relations, Favourable press mentions, hot viral videos, and featured app store placements are all effective ways to gain attention. </li>
<li>Relationship Triggers: One person telling others about a product or service can be a highly effective external trigger. Whether through electronic invitations, a Facebook like and share, or just simple word of mouth - referrals from friends and family are a key reason for adoption. Relationship triggers can create viral hyper-growth for offerings. </li>
<li>Owned Triggers: Triggers that consistently show up in the user</span>’s use space - an app icon, a notification, a daily email update etc. These triggers are only set after users sign up for an account, submit their contact details, install an app etc. </li>
<li>Internal Triggers: Emotions  (such as boredom, confusion, loneliness, indecision, stress), routines, and thoughts that function as prompts for users. The deep association of a product/service with such triggers can drive users towards a product or service. </li>
<li>'Action:' The ways in which the user</span>’s interaction with the product/service can be eased. The aim is to enhance ease of use with regards to six main elements - </li>
<li>Time: The amount of time it takes to complete an action. </li>
<li>Money: The monetary cost of taking an action. </li>
<li>Physical effort: The amount of labour involved in taking an action. </li>
<li>Brain cycles: The level of mental effort and focus required to take an action. </li>
<li>Social deviance: The level of acceptance an action has from others.</li>
<li>Non-routine: The level to which the action matches or disrupts existing routines. </li>
<li>'Variable Rewards:' Variable rewards are defined as rewards that vary with time and are somewhat unpredictable - helping keep the novelty of the user experience, and creating engagement. There are three fundamental types of rewards that a product/service can be associated with:</li>
<li>Reward of the Tribe: Rewards fuelled by the need to be connected to, accepted, recognised, admired, respected etc. by other people. </li>
<li>Reward of the Hunt: Rewards fuelled by the need to acquire physical products/material resources, and information.</li>
<li>Reward of the Self: Rewards fuelled by ‘<span>intrinsic motivations</span>’ focused on self development and growth such as the need to acquire a sense of mastery, competence, or completion. </li>
<li>'Investment:' The more users invest time and effort into a product or service, the more they value it. The different forms in which users can become invested in a product/service include:</li>
<li>Content: The collection of memories and experiences, in aggregate, becomes more valuable over time and a product/ service becomes harder to leave as users</span>’ personal investment grows. </li>
<li>Data: The more information users share and link with a product or service, the more committed they become to it. </li>
<li>Network: The more invested users</span>’ are in a network of people - as a follower, a friend, as someone with followers - the less likely they are to abandon a product or service and start over.</li>
<li>Reputation: The reputation that users build or earn over time makes them stay invested over long periods of time. </li>
<li>Skill: Once users have invested the effort to acquire a skill, they are less likely to switch to a competing product. </li>
</ul>

							<h2>Step by Step</h2>
						</div>
						
						<ol>
<li><span>Familiarise yourself:</span> Read through the various boxes of the HOOK Model and consider how these may apply to the current or proposed product/ service solution.</li>
<li><span>First Time/New User:</span> You may begin by thinking of how a first time or new user is being taken through the steps. You may begin by mapping the current journey and then identify gaps.</li>
<li><span>Existing Users:</span> Next, you may think of an existing user or a repeat user who can potentially stay with the product or service for a long time. You can begin by mapping current journey and then identify gaps. </li>
<li><span>Brainstorm & Discuss:</span> Based on the gaps identified for new and current users, you may next identify potential solutions to try out. These ideas can be discussed as a team or a group.</li>

					<h2>How to for Facilitators</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).</li>
<li><span></li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Start with a discussion focused on why habit forming products and services are important. Walk them through the tool, and then move along the cycle from triggers to investment. Teams can be asked to map what they do currently, identify gaps and think of new ways they can look at the steps. </li>
<li><span></li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants walk you through the worksheet they have filled out and probe them on their mapping of the current and their ideas for things they can try out.  </li>

					<h2>Facilitators Question Bank</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>What are you solving for? Is that important enough for users to keep coming back?</li>
<li>Who are you trying to create sticky products and services for? - - - Why is habitual use  important for your product/service if at all?</li>
<li>How are you thinking of creating stickiness for a new / first time user? How are you thinking of creating stickiness for an existing user?</li>
<li>What kind of triggers have you considered currently? What have you not considered? What is the main internal trigger you are focused on? Do examples come to mind that you can potentially learn from? </li>
<li>How easy is it for first time and existing users to use your product or service? What can be eased based on your understanding of what their needs are? Are there examples that you can learn from?</li>
<li>How are users being rewarded? Is the reward evident? Are you considering the three types of rewards? Any examples you can borrow from? </li>
<li>How are you ensuring that users stay invested in your product/service? What kind of investments do you want them to make? Is the investment negatively impacting ease and trust? Are there any examples you can learn from?</li>
<li>Are you encouraging the useful, positive habits for your users or are you thinking only from your own perspective? </li>
