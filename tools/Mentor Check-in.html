<li>The following template is only a recommendation for a typical flow with a mentor. 'Introduce yourself' and your role at your company. </li>
<li>Make sure to be mindful of the time alloted and decide how to best 'Present your product or service': should it be a one minute pitch or a longer fifteen minutes presentation? </li>
<li>Prepare a few questions you'd like to 'Collect feedback' on and expect more questions and input from the mentors. The last part often runs short so make sure you factor in enough time for a fruitful discussion after presenting your solution.</li>
