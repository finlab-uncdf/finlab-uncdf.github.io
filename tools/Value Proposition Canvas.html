						<h2>About</h2>
						
						<p>The Value Proposition Canvas is a tool which helps ensure that a product or service is positioned around what the customer values and needs. The Canvas was initially developed by Dr Alexander Osterwalder as a framework to ensure that there is a fit between the product and market. It is a detailed look at the relationship between two parts of the broader Business Model Canvas tool - customer segments and value proposition.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>Use Cases</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Define a new offering is being developed from scratch through the lens of customers. </li>
<li>Refine an existing product or service offering through the lens of what customers need and value</li>
<li>Link customer personas and profiles to the overall value proposition and to the business model. </li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>Limitations</h2>
						
						<p>The Value Proposition Canvas is related closely to the Business Model Canvas.Thus, the value proposition created using the canvas has to be connected and evolved further using the business model canvas. In isolation, the canvas does not fully communicate the investments and activities involved. </p>

					<ul>
<li>Customer Profile Map:' This section focuses on the customers</span>â€™ key characteristics and needs. A customer profile can be created for each customer segment, as each segment has distinct gains, pains and jobs - and value propositions can be different for each. </li>
<li>Customer jobs are the functional, social and emotional tasks customers are have to perform, problems they are trying to solve and needs they wish to satisfy. These could be broad (for a new product) or specific to a solution that is already being offered. </li>
<li>Gains are the benefits that the customer expects and needs, and those that can delight while going about the jobs.</li>
<li>Pains are the negative experiences, emotions and risks that the customer  wants to avoid while getting the jobs done.</li>
<li>'Value Map:' This section focuses on how one can design products or services to meet customer needs. Each part of this map relates back to the Customer Profile Map.</li>
<li>Products & Services are the things provided for a particular market segment/customer profile. These are directly related to the customer jobs.</li>
<li>Pain Relievers are things that aid your customers and make their lives easier - focus on how provided  products and services are pain relievers. </li>
<li>Gain Creators are those things that maximise customer outcomes and benefits - focus on how provided products and services are gain creators. </li>
<li>'Value Proposition:' This section is to be used to summarise the overall value proposition across different customer profiles and value maps. </li>

							<h2>Step by Step</h2>

						<ol>
<li><span>Familiarise yourself:</span> Read through the template and discuss what each map and each section within the map mean.</li>
<li><span>Build the Customer Profile Map:</span> Choose the customer profile/segment to build the customer profile map for. Start with the customer jobs and then move to pains and gains. Differentiate between road and specific observations. </li>
<li><span>Build the Value Map:</span> Move to the value map. Begin by detailing that product and service features that reflect the customer jobs. Move then to gain creators and pain relievers. </li>
<li><span>Define Value Proposition:</span> Summarise the overall value proposition that is evolving as a result of the exercise. Do this for each customer profile and finally as a summary across profiles. </li>
<li><span>Review & Discuss:</span> Review the findings and discuss the big takeaways and learnings as a group.</li>

					<h2>How to for Facilitators</h2>
					
					<ol>
<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Start with a discussion on how well the teams understand their value proposition and if they have considered unique propositions for each customer profile. Ask teams to refer to their customer personas and business model canvases (if already developed). </li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have participants walk you through the worksheet they have filled out. Probe them on their final value propositions and how they have gone about driving them. </li>
</ol>

					<h2>Facilitators Question Bank</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Are you looking to define a new value proposition or improve on what exists currently?</li>
<li>How well do you understand your customers? Has your research covered enough ground to be able to map your customers?</li>
<li>How many different personas and profiles do you have? Do you wish to develop customer maps for each or do you want to focus on one?</li>
<li>Are you clear on what your customer jobs are? Are these linked to the product or service features?</li>
<li>What is painful for your customers as they interact with your solution or existing solutions? How can you remove this pain?</li>
<li>What creates gain and benefit for your customers? How can you maximize this gain? </li>
<li>As you build customer and value maps for each customer segment/persona - have you considered which of the propositions and solutions to prioritise?</li>
<li>How will you prioritise them?</li>
<li>As you build customer and value maps for each customer segment/persona - what is the overall value proposition that seems to be evolving?</li>
<li>How unique is your overall value proposition?</li>
