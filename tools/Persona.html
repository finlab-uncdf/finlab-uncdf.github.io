						<h2>About</h2>
						
						<p>Personas are fictional “characters” that represent a type of user or stakeholder for whom a design or solution has to be developed. The persona is not a generic demographic profile but a summary of needs, behaviours, motivations, and challenges that helps provide us the foundation on which to create a solution.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>Use Cases</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Establishing needs and challenges of the target user/customer.</li>
<li>Humanising the research insights that will inspire the solution is being created.</li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>Limitations</h2>
						
						<p>A persona may not be able to accurately cover a segment of a target user as there may be interesting outliers and exceptions to consider, which could be missed as a result of sticking to a single persona.</p>

<li>The ‘<span>Name</span>’ and ‘<span>Relevant Demographics</span>’ section of the tool is to be filled out with the basic details and categorisation of the target user, such as Age, Gender, Income, Family, Occupation.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>About</span>’ will be filled in with basic background information about the target user, which can help in giving context to the persona.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Broad Goals</span>’ is to be filled in with the aspirations and motivations of the user, and what they want in life. This can be made specific to the context at hand.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Specific Needs/Problems</span>’ will document the problems and needs of the user, specific to the context of the problem being addressed.</li>
<li>‘<span>Specific Behaviours</span>’ will include more detail into the current behaviours and actions of the user.</li>
<li>‘<span>Specific Motivators</span>’ can help get more insight into the motivations of the user, and what would encourage them to engage with a potential solution.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Specific Pain Points</span>’ will document pain points of the user relevant to the context, and what would prevent them from engaging with a potential solution.</li>
<li>‘<span>Quotes</span>’ will have specific sayings or sentences taken from user interviews which help summarise or support the users perspective on the problem being addressed.</li>

<li><span>At the start:</span> Make sure the participants understand the exercise and guide them through the activity with examples.</li>
<li><span>During the exercise:</span> Ask if the participants can add any other details or add more fields to the template.</li>
<li><span>When summarising:</span> Have the participants walk you through the persona, and ask questions to spot any gaps in the template. </li>

					<h2>Facilitators Question Bank</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>Do you see a pattern amongst the users? Is there a larger archetype you can build a persona for?</li>
<li>Do you have enough information needed to define the persona? Do you have information across the different categories called out on the template?</li>
<li>Do you see patterns that are different enough to make more than one persona? Are the types have significantly different perspectives or aspirations?</li>
<li>Do the personas have different kinds of journeys? Do they have significantly different needs?</li>
<li>Are there any quotes from the research you’d like to highlight?</li>
