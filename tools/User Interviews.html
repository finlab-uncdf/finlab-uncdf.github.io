					<div class="tool-about">
						<h2>About</h2>
						
						<p>Collecting first-hand accounts of experiences, needs and concerns can be a great source of inspiration. To do so participants will have to translate their lines of inquiry and research themes into open-ended questions that will encourage candid, insightful conversations.</p>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-use-case">
						<h2>Use Cases</h2>
						
						<ul>
<li>Gaining a deep understanding  of target users as well as the influencers or service gatekeepers involved in the service provision (agents, tech platforms, government bodies)</li>
<li>Evaluating the value and reception of early concepts as part of their innovation and prototyping activities.  </li>
</ul>
					</div>
					
					<div class="tool-limitations">
						<h2>Limitations</h2>
						
						<p>User interviews will provide personal, grounded perspectives into a respondent’s frame of mind and values but, unlike quantitative research, will not inform how wide-spread or common such behaviors are. Secondary research can help complement this gap.</p>

					<h2>Understand</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>For a smooth interview, the interviewer should prepare a simple Discussion Guide. This will help them keep track of the discussion and ensure all the intended topics are covered. Such a guide should be prepared by the interviewer and their team, it can me a couple bullet points for more experienced interviewers or clearly written out questions for new learners.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Personal Introduction</span>’ helps set the tone of the interview and establish mutual respect. If the session is to be recorded this is a good time to request consent from the respondent.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Icebreaker</span>’ can simply be a set of questions or an activity that is easy for the participant to complete to get them more comfortable with the interview. These can be simple questions like their age, professional activity, their hobbies or what a typical day looks like for them.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Open-Ended Questions</span>’ should be formulated to help participants open up and share as much as possible about the experience being discussed.</li>
<li>The ‘<span>Follow-Up Questions</span>’ help the interviewer better understand the why and the how of a story: Why has a person done what they did? How do they feel about it? Was it confusing? Challenging? Empowering? Such questions will result in the identification of potential pain points to be addressed by the product or service being designed.</li>

							<h2>Step by Step</h2>

						<div class="tool-step-segment"> <span>1. Introduce yourself: </span> Framing the discussion by clearly establishing who you are and a simple, clear description of the purpose of the research helps set a respectful stage for the discussion.</div>
<div class="tool-step-segment"> <span>2. Break the ice: </span> Use a couple easy to answer questions to make the respondent feel more comfortable before asking them more in-depth questions.</div>
<div class="tool-step-segment"> <span>3. Ask open-ended questions: </span> The purpose of user research is to get in the shoes of the respondents. The best way to get there is to ask for stories and specific lived events through open-ended questions.</div>
<div class="tool-step-segment"> <span>4. Follow-up questions: </span> Follow-up questions help you dig deeper behind specific aspects of the stories to understand the motivations that drive the respondents and the challenges they face.</div>

					<h2>Facilitators Question Bank</h2>
					
					<ul>
<li>What are the main information gaps you’d like clarity on? Refer to the problem tree and stakeholder mapping if you are not sure where to start.</li>
<li>Who do you plan on speaking to? Why? How and where will you reach them?</li>
<li>What are the key questions we want to ask? Are we looking at behaviors, motivations, needs through the questions we are asking?</li>
<li>Are there any sensitive topics in our discussion guide? How can we indirectly approach the topics? Are they necessary?</li>
