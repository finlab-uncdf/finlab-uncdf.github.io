1,"STRATEGY, INNOVATION & IMPACT",VISION BUILDING,Startup Canvas,The canvas summarises the most important elements of an organisation’s business model and is especially useful for early stage startups. The version of the canvas being used here is inspired by the Lean methodology and business model canvas.,The canvas tool is not a problem solving tool as such. It has limited capacity to answer what the ‘right’ model for a business is. It is best used as an evolving summary or dashboard. ,90-120 Min,"Investigating and mapping how ideas or solutions could be transformed into a holistic business model. 
Mapping current business models, identifying gaps and opportunities (priorities), and outlining  interdependencies. 
Using the canvas as a dashboard to document each stage of evolution of the business model, and reflecting on investments and results.","1. Familiarise yourself: Read through the various boxes in the Startup Canvas, you’ll notice the left two columns have to do with internal activity and the two to the right refer to external forces.
2. Get started: As a business, what do you have most clarity on? Is it your understanding of your customer segment or of the needs your are addressing through your business? Use these questions to decide which side of the canvas to start on.
3. Complete: Go through each box and fill out as much as you can. It is completely fine not to know the answer to specific areas.
4. Identify Knowledge Gaps: Once the worksheet is completed to the best your knowledge, jot down in a different color remaining knowledge gaps. Do you have clear revenue streams? Do you have strong metrics to track your progress?","The ‘Problem’ section is to be used to highlight the core problems that users face and that the startup is attempting to solve, not those that the startup is facing as an organisation. 
‘Customer Segments’ requires the startup to identify the specific profile of the users for whom the problem is most acutely felt. Profiles can be very specific and also quantised in terms of segments/market size. 
‘Solution’ is how the startup plans to address the problem - it could be a product, service, system or a combination of them. 
‘Unfair Advantage’ is the distinct, hard to copy competitive advantage the startup enjoys. 
‘Unique Value Proposition’ is the core compelling message for the user that communicates the value the startup is creating for them. 
‘Channels’ are the ways in which the user will interact with the solution. These could include ways that users will become of the solution, experience it for the first time, purchase and continue to use. 
‘Key Metrics’ are the ways the business can measure its success. These could include impressions, downloads, sign ups, transactions, value of transactions, renewals etc. 
‘Cost Structure’ is the way the costs are distributed between fixed and variable, and capital investments and operational costs. 
‘Revenue Streams’ are the ways in which revenue is to be generated - whether its one time, subscription, loyalty fees etc.","At the start: Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).
During the exercise: Start with participants’ existing knowledge of their business to create a first version of the model. Encourage the participants to highlight any component the participants don’t know the answer to for later reference. 
When summarising: Have participants walk you through the canvas they have created and probe on what is their core strengths and weaknesses they would like to build upon. ","Which part of the business do you have the best view on? What are you least informed on?
Is there anything in here you’d like to understand better? Eg. customer segment, value proposition, etc. 
Do you expect your fundamental model and this canvas to change in the next 6 months?
Can you think of any other things you’d like to add to this canvas? Are there any links between boxes you’d like to call out?
Did challenges shared as part of the startup journey resonate with you? Which did you think was most relevant for your company?
What are your company’s goals in the next 3-6-12 months? Are you considering them as you map your priorities?
How do you know something is a priority? Is there understanding within your company that these are the top priorities and challenges, or is there some assumption involved?
Do your priorities depend on each other? Are there 1-2 core priorities at the root of all the different challenges you might be facing?",,name_illust,name_tool,name_card,name.pdf

3,"STRATEGY, INNOVATION & IMPACT",VISION BUILDING,Product Roadmap,Roadmapping is an important step of clarifying the direction of a startup or programme over the next few years. It helps the team align on which challenges to prioritise and the ideal path moving forward.,"Created for and by the Startup community this format may feel a little tedious, participants should feel comfortable adapting the template to their needs.",60-90 Min,"Building consensus on the company or programme’s strategic direction. 
Identifying key milestones and responsibilities of each team. 
Formulating an actionable plan for the team to work towards.",,"The ‘Team’ column refers to any team involved in the process of developing each phase and clearly identifying key roles and responsibilities. Teams can include marketing, developers, strategy or any other arm of the practice involved in the development of the product or the program. 
‘POC’ or Proof Of Concept is the first tangible version of the concept. It should validate assumptions regarding the functionality and desirability of the product without necessarily having resolved all the technical issues with it.
‘MVP’ short for Minimum Viable Product, refers to the earliest version of a digital product, it is a streamlined version of the service or product (only contains key, necessary features) used to understand where the core of the business opportunity lies.  
‘Alpha’ is the first release with actual users in a controlled environment like a Focus Group Discussion (FGD). This allows for feedback from real users without having to resolve all the bugs or technical challenges behind the product or service.
‘Beta’ is the first public release used to gather feedback from a wide array of users.
‘Launch’ milestones should cover any final challenges regarding going to market like landing strategic partnerships or additional features to be integrated based on feedback on previous iterations.
‘Success Metrics’ should be defined based on the goals and milestones set for each phase of development, these are metrics used to validate assumptions and to make a case for continuing the development of the project all along the way.","At the start: Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).
During the exercise: Help participants understand where they stand on the roadmap and if any edits should be made to the template. 
When summarising: Make sure clear milestones have been formulated, and encourage participants to get input from representatives of the teams listed in the roadmap that may not have been available for the activity. ","Are you familiar with this format? Do you have your own version in your organisation?
How far are you currently on this roadmap? Should anything on here be changed?
Who / What are your core team in your organisation? Let’s list them in the left column.

",30-60 Min,"Building consensus on the organisation or programme. 
Identifying potential risks to address. 
Identifying factors that differentiate a given business or programme from the competition. ","1. Discuss: Discuss with your team how your startup or program is doing by going through each of the four quadrants. Make sure at least one person is taking notes.
2. Populate: Start adding the notes into their respective quadrants, add any new thoughts that come to mind.
3. Summarise and Review: Highlight the key points for each quadrant with a few words. Once done, consider reviewing with a few more stakeholders in your company and see how to build on your Weaknesses and Threats.","The ‘Strengths’ section is to be used to highlight what the programme or business does best, could be their activity, team composition, network or any other. 
‘Weaknesses’ will cover internal shortcomings of the team or product. 
‘Opportunities’ should address external trends and forces that could provide unique opportunities for the organisation in question. 
‘Threats’ are the external factors risking to limit or hinder the organisation’s activity. ","At the start: Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).
During the exercise: Start with participants’ personal understanding of their activity to create a first version of the activity then use the questions provided to dig deeper.

6,"STRATEGY, INNOVATION & IMPACT",VISION BUILDING,Theory of Change,Theory of Change (TOC) is a framework that attempts to map how desired change is being achieved through intended  activities and investments. It also helps participants differentiate between results and impact. The framework is useful in calibrating strategy - especially in the social impact and development sector.  ,"While the TOC helps layout an overall strategy, there is little guarantee that activities and resources will eventually translate into impact on ground. TOCs are often revisited and refined as results from the real world emerge.",90-120 Min,"Creating an end to end summary of the intended impact strategy of a programme or business when conceptualising it. 
Diagnosing and reflecting on actual impact and to finetune a strategy. In the world of impact investing, the TOC is used to understand how innovators may create greater impact via the investments they may be seeking. ","1. Define a vision: Discuss with the team what the intended impact of the program or service should be.
2. Unpack the necessary resources: First fill in the left side of the tool to establish the basic financial, staff, staff and network resources needed to roll out the programme.
3. Link the efforts to the impact: Then link these resources and activities to outputs and outcomes that will lead to the impact you defined in the first step.
4. Identify blindspots: Before ending the session, review the template and look for assumptions you might be making about each step or how they link to each other.","The ‘Resources & Inputs’ section is to meant to park the human, knowledge, skill,  financial, technological, infrastructural, systemic capabilities that are required by an innovator or entrepreneur as they look to create impact. 
‘Activities’ are those tasks that the resources will help undertake. The nature of these tasks could be both user facing (awareness building, onboarding, servicing etc.) and internal (process development, skill building, hiring, technology adoption etc.) - although the former is of higher priority. Investors needs to be clear that the resources are being spent on priority activities.   
‘Outputs’ are the most basic numbers and metrics that will help measure the quantity of results from the investment into resources and activities. Without going into whether the efforts were successful or not, the outputs help understand the extent of effort (for example - number of people reached, campaigns undertaken, number of learning sessions held etc.)  
‘Outcomes’ are deeper metrics than outputs and start focusing on both the quantity and quality of results. The focus is most importantly on short-medium term impact metrics (for example - number and type of conversions from those reached, level of awareness in people because of campaign, skills built in people because of learning sessions etc.) 
‘Impact’ focuses on longer term results and change. The section focuses on real, lasting impact created by the interventions. The meaningfulness of the outcomes and outputs is really brought to fore here (for example - conversions influencing behaviour, awareness leading to better decision making and choice, skills leading to ability to sustain financially etc.)
‘Assumptions’ are risk factors that the innovator is not quite sure of as the TOC is being built. They need to be validated as the TOC is iterated on.","At the start: Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck). 
During the exercise: Start with participants’ existing knowledge of their activity to create a first version of the map.
When summarising: Have participants walk you through the map, step by step to spot any gaps or mistakes. ","What are the key resources and capabilities that you need to need to access?
What are the resources you have currently? What require additional investments?
What activities are your focus as of now? What resources do you need for these activities? What will these activities help you achieve?
What are the first level of results or outputs that the resources and activities will let you achieve?
How are you differentiating between outputs and outcomes? Are you clear on how outputs will translate into outcomes? 
Are your outcomes purely quantitative? What is the qualitative element in them? And vice versa.
Are you being able to differentiate between short-medium term and long term impact?
What does long term impact mean to you? Is it clear or do you feel that it is too abstract at this stage? 
What kind of impact did you have in mind when you started working on the program or startup? Is that being reflected here?
Do the desired impact and the resources available match up? Are you sure you are being realistic in your estimation?
What are the key assumptions for you at each stage? Why are these your assumptions? What can you do to minimise these assumptions?",,,,,
7,"STRATEGY, INNOVATION & IMPACT",PLANNING & PROJECT MANAGEMENT,Activity Plan,"The Activity Plan is an activity which helps teams plan out their activities, and assign resources and teams to tasks. Team members should outline detailed tasks or activities necessary to achieve higher-level goals. ","The Activity Plan is only as effective as the amount of detail it has. The more detailed the responsibilities and checkpoints are, the more likely the team is to use it.",30 Min,"Planning out activities for the team for the upcoming months

2. Allocate Resources: Allocate the necessary resources needed to complete the respective tasks, keeping the timeline and the availability of resources in mind.
3.Build consensus: Make sure the team collectively agrees with the plan.","The ‘Timeline’ section can be filled following 3-6-9-12 months or can be rewritten to the timeline of the participant’s choice. These increments should be spaced close or far enough from each other for all parties to feel in touch with the on-going project.
The ‘Tasks to be Completed’ section is where the tasks/activities to be completed are listed down. These are the tasks that the team is confident of completing by the time given.
The ‘Resources Needed’ section is where the resources needed to fulfill the tasks by the given time are written down. This can be financial, server access or staffing resources.
‘Teams Involved’ are the teams directly responsible for the tasks to be completed. ","At the start: Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck). 
During the exercise: Start with participants’ existing knowledge of their activities and tasks to help them create an initial version of the plan.
When summarising: Have participants walk you through their plan and help them space out activities/timelines as needed.","Are the timelines listed realistic? Do they fit within the time between bootcamps or workshops?
Does the team have the capability to complete the tasks/activities within the given timeframes?
Does the intent of the team match the activities and resources they plan to commit to?
Can the team add more detail or criteria to the map for a more well defined project management plan?",,,,,
8,"STRATEGY, INNOVATION & IMPACT",PLANNING & PROJECT MANAGEMENT,SMART Goals,"Setting actionable goals can be challenging, SMART goals help the team take time to think through the goals and make sure they are achievable.","SMART goals should be used on the back of a strategic exercise, they are are meant to ensure goals are clearly detailed rather than a tool to choose the identify or prioritise new goals.",30 Min,"Build consensus on the next steps to adopt. 
Clearly define goals for the team to hold each other accountable over. ","1. Pick a goal or set of goals: Take the nearest goals in your strategy roadmap and use this worksheet to clarify them.
2. Clarify: Break down each goal according to the five components in the left column.
3. Get buy-in: Discuss with the team the goals set and challenge each other to make sure they are  feasible and realistic.","‘Specific’ is the box in which to clearly define the what of the goal. 
‘Measurable’ should cover any metric or numerical representation of the program or organisation’s activity in order to track progress. 
‘Achievable’ should describe the steps necessary to reaching the goal in question. 
‘Relevant’ should answer the why of the goal, why is it relevant to the participant’s programme or organisation.
‘Time-Bound’ should factor in the time constraints of this goal, is it short or long term? Does it align with any key dates? Pitches, Launches, Funding deadlines? ","At the start: Help participants identify which goals to prioritise, it might be useful to refer to any strategy or roadmapping exercise completed prior to this.
During the exercise: Help participants formulate their goals and identify unexpected challenges in meeting them. 
When summarising: Have participants share the goals by email with the organisers to make sure everyone is on the same page. ","What goals or milestones have you identified so far?

12,HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN,DICOVER,Problem Tree + 5 Whys,"Problem Tree is a tool used to identify effects and causes of a given challenge. The aim is to repeatedly unpack each symptom until one reaches a “root cause” or unexpected angle from which to think of the problem. While traditionally the tool is looked only through a problem lens, it can also use it to appreciate opportunities. 5 Whys are an activity that can be run during  the Problem Tree to help participants get to the root cause of the topic.",The Problem Tree does not give any indication of the magnitude or the importance of the causes of the problem or opportunity area. It may also be difficult to understand the effects and causes right from the beginning and may require a few iterations of this activity.,60 Min,"Reframing a problem or topic to make sure the way the problem is understood by the group is the best way to look at it.
Uncovering unexpected opportunities in the space a team or organisation is working in.","1. State the proble: Start by drawing a tree trunk, label it with the main problem or opportunity that you are looking to work on.
2. List the effects: It’s often easier to get started by listing the visible effects of the the problem at hand and then trying to identify the more indirect impact the problem might have.
3. List the causes: Start listing what the team sees as the causes for the given problem or opportunity statement. Again, try to identify indirect causes for the problem at hand.
4. Dig deeper: To really get into the depth (or root cause) keep asking why each cause exists until you feel that you have a strong enough root cause.","The ‘Problem/Opportunity’ section should be something specific that has been chosen to be investigated. This could be the problem faced by the user, or an opportunity area defined by the startup (this can be taken from the problems listed in the Startup Canvas) or organisation.
The ‘Effects’ are what happens as a result of the problem. These symptoms should be written in the branches of the tree. For example, if the problem is defined as ‘Poor Public Transport’, then an effect would probably be, ‘Commuter getting late to work’, or ‘Expensive private transport options’.
The ‘Causes’ are the reasons why the problem causes the effects. The aim is to write down as many clear and concise reasons in the roots of the tree. Following up on the same example, the root cause of ‘Poor Public Transport’ could probably be, ‘Inadequate public funding’ or ‘Poor route planning’.
The levels to which the ‘Effects’ and the ‘Causes’ can be unpacked will vary depending on the understanding the team has of the topic at hand. There is no pressure to be exhaustive - it is meant to start the planning process - not to complete the analysis. 
 The Problem Tree provides a visual breakdown of problems into their symptoms as well as their causes, and furthermore create a visual output that can be understood by anyone.","At the start: Explain the activity to the participants, preferably using examples. Make sure they first write down the effects and then the causes.
During the exercise: Ensure that the participants don’t get stuck or fixate on a single train of thought.
When summarising: Have participants share their root causes and talk through their process of getting to the root cause.
","What are the most immediate causes and effects you can think of as a group?
Have we gone deep enough? Can we unpack this effect / cause further?
Why does [cause] happen? Can we list those reasons as well as sub causes?
What root causes have we identified? Are any of those surprising or unexpected?
Since we have to use this as an input for planning research in the next phase, what are some themes (to be taken from effects or causes) that you feel we need to focus on understanding better during research?
How should we prioritise between causes? Which ones do you think are the most important? Is there a cause that we are all excited about trying to solve? ",,,,,
13,HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN,DISCOVER,Stakeholder Map,"Stakeholder Maps are used to provide a sense of the ecosystem of people, institutions, organisations, and any other entities who have an influence or stake with respect to a target audience.

Validating assumptions for those who do not have a complete understanding of the ecosystem as they move forward.","1. List stakeholders: The easiest way to get started is to list all the stakeholders that come to mind right away.
2. Reorganise groups: Once the stakeholders are listed, review their placement on the map with the team. There might be disagreements regarding which circle a stakeholder might fit in or the reach of their influence.
3. Call out dynamics: The last step will be to draw connections between the stakeholders to understand their relationships. In doing so, new stakeholders should emerge. ","The ‘Target User’ section is to be kept focused on individuals or groups that the startup or organisation is trying to solution for. 
‘Direct Influencers’ are those that most influence the attitudes and behaviours of the target audience. One can look at these influencers as those with only one degree of separation. For example - college students may be influenced by their peers, the retail ecosystem around them, college authorities and even their parents  in their choice of a fintech solution. 
‘Indirect Influencers’ are those that somewhat influence the target audience but their impact is left direct. There are two or more degrees of separation between the target and these stakeholders. For example - looking again at college students, such influencers might be administrators, state legislation, scholarship funds etc. 
‘Societal Norms’ are the forces that may not have a direct representative but are still important to take into account. For example - political climate, market trends, cultural norms.","At the start: Explain the activity to the participants, preferably using examples. Make sure they first start from the center and move outwards.
During the exercise: Help them think of stakeholders if they get stuck or can’t think of anything to write. Create connections, and think of the influences on the stakeholders written on the map.
When summarising: Have participants walk you through the process of finding connections, and point out important stakeholders/connections they found.","Who have you chosen as the target user? Can you add a some description so that everyone is on the same page?

Different methods such as Secondary Research, Primary Research, User Interviews, amongst others can be used. The research methods selected should take into account the nature of information needed and those who can provide it. 
The ‘Key lines of Inquiry’ are derived from the Foundation phase, where tools such as the Problem Tree+5 Whys and the Stakeholder Map can highlight information gaps, or potential areas of research.
The ‘Key Questions’ refer to 2-3 questions (per line of inquiry) the team would like to ask questions on or find answers to in their secondary research.
The ‘Research Tools’ box should cover any tool or template to be used during research activities.  For example, using a Stakeholder Mapping exercise during user or expert interviews can help consolidate the team’s understanding of the matter.
The ‘Research Participants’ box is specifically for User and Expert Research methods. The group should use this box to discuss who might be good to speak to and who can easily be recruited within the given timeframe.
‘Person Responsible’ is meant to highlight the various roles and responsibilities. Since research can be a demanding and time consuming task, the teams should carefully divy up the work.","At the start: Explain the activity to the participants, if participants are feeling stuck, help them by filling out a row with them.
During the exercise: Make sure that they refer to the previous tools to include lines of inquiry or knowledge gaps that they had previously identified.
When summarising: Have the participants share their plan and see if they have assigned the research methods that seem relevant to the lines of inquiry and that the participants feel comfortable using.","Are all the information gaps from the Foundation stage being addressed in the research plan?
Is the plan realistic? Will the team be able to successfully complete all the research tasks?

Prepare for the interview: First look into the expert you will be speaking to’s activity and writing to build a foundational knowledge of what the discussion will be about.
2. Introduce yourself: Start the interview by introducing yourself and building credibility.
3. Conduct the interview: Go through the questions you have for the expert and take notes (record audio if you have consent).
4. Conclude the interview: At the end of your interview ask the expert if there is anything else they’d like to add or cover on the topic.","The key part of an expert interview is the preparation. The participants should familiarise themselves with the experts’ work prior to interviews and prepare a few ‘Notes on their work or activity’ to refer back to during the interview.
The ‘Interview Questions’ should be clear and prioritised so the most important questions can come up earlier in the interview in case the interview is cut short.","At the start: Help participants clearly identify the themes or lines of inquiry they’d like to research.

Introduce yourself: Framing the discussion by clearly establishing who you are and a simple, clear description of the purpose of the research helps set a respectful stage for the discussion.
2. Break the ice: Use a couple easy to answer questions to make the respondent feel more comfortable before asking them more in-depth questions.
3. Ask open-ended questions: The purpose of user research is to get in the shoes of the respondents. The best way to get there is to ask for stories and specific lived events through open-ended questions.
4. Follow-up questions: Follow-up questions help you dig deeper behind specific aspects of the stories to understand the motivations that drive the respondents and the challenges they face.","For a smooth interview, the interviewer should prepare a simple Discussion Guide. This will help them keep track of the discussion and ensure all the intended topics are covered. Such a guide should be prepared by the interviewer and their team, it can me a couple bullet points for more experienced interviewers or clearly written out questions for new learners.
The ‘Personal Introduction’ helps set the tone of the interview and establish mutual respect. If the session is to be recorded this is a good time to request consent from the respondent.
The ‘Icebreaker’ can simply be a set of questions or an activity that is easy for the participant to complete to get them more comfortable with the interview. These can be simple questions like their age, professional activity, their hobbies or what a typical day looks like for them.
The ‘Open-Ended Questions’ should be formulated to help participants open up and share as much as possible about the experience being discussed.
The ‘Follow-Up Questions’ help the interviewer better understand the why and the how of a story: Why has a person done what they did? How do they feel about it? Was it confusing? Challenging? Empowering? Such questions will result in the identification of potential pain points to be addressed by the product or service being designed.","At the start: Help participants clearly identify the themes or lines of inquiry they’d like to research.

3. Identify misfit cards: If it is felt the cards don’t fit into any particular category - then keep them aside and come back to them later.","The ‘Category/Level/Preference/Stage’ is the section where the researcher needs to decide what is being mapped. Is it preference (for example - out of multiple features on an online commerce site - what is prefered?), sequence (for example - what should be on the home page and what should follow?), or just a matter of simple categorisation (for example - these features represent the known and these are new)? The categories can be defined by the researcher (closed sort) or left to the user (open sort). It is ideal to start with defined categories.   
‘Attributes/Topics/Events’ are the content factors that are used to populate the cards. These are ideally represented by visuals and supporting descriptions. Sometimes researchers also use cards that are just text based (adjectives, verbs, emotions etc.). The researcher has the option of creating multiple versions (for example - multiple login screen options) of a card in case the idea is to capture preference. 
The researcher is responsible for setting the context and then letting the respondent move forward with the exercise. As the card sorting is taking place, the researcher can ask questions and engage in conversation. For this, the researcher must be confident of why individual cards are part of the bundle - what they represent and what their sorting in particular categories could mean in terms of insights. 
The exercise can be used as a tool for exploration or for definition and decision making. Although it is better suited as for exploration and needs to be supported with more in-depth conversations. 
The exercise can be done with individual research respondents or in a group. ","At the start: Make sure the participants understand the flow of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).

This could be in terms of  decades/months/weeks (for example - 1990s, 2000s, 2010s) or even life stages (for example - childhood/teenage/youth). The choice of time frames is flexible and to be decided by the researcher. 
 ‘What?’ is the section in which participants’ inputs on objects/events/actions/behaviours/beliefs that best fit into a particular time period  are noted down (for example - music in the 90s was about the Sony Walkman, in the 2000s it was about the iPod, in 2010s all music was on smartphones).
‘Where?’ is the section in which the input from the participant is focused on description of location - physical spaces/ geographies/sectors/internet that can add some further context to the ‘What?’ section (for example - music in the 90s was about the local music store and music at cafes, in 2000s about iTunes and pirated MP3 collections, and in the 2010s about streaming platforms like Spotify).

4. Expand into Opportunities: In order to ease the transition into problem solving, How Might We statements can be used to identify possible strategies or objectives to strive for.","The purpose of this activity is to translate findings or ‘Key Takeaways’ into consolidated ‘Insights’ and ‘Opportunities’. To do so, the team will pull from their affinity mapping exercise to identify valuable takeaways. Those will be written in the ‘Key Takeaways’ box.
Related takeaways might then form a new understanding of the context at hand or of the user’s needs. These should be captured as ‘Insights’. There are two parts to an insight, a support statement which explains how the team’s findings inform a new understanding of the context at hand by bringing together in a single sentence the situation observed, the challenges faced by the users and the user’s perspective on the matter. Together they should represent a new understanding the team has derived from those. This support statement can then be summarised into a crisper statement that will become the insight statement.
Insights are by definition intended to be enlightening, however they can be challenging to translate into ‘Opportunities’.

When summarising: Have participants choose five principles to move  forward with.","Is there a question that speaks to you? You can start there if you’d like.
Is there anything the team categorically agrees should not be considered?
Is there anything your solution should be or do?
Does everyone agree with [point out a principle]? Should it be adjusted?",,,,,

33,HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN,IDEATION,Design Challenge,Defining a ‘Design Challenge’ is a good way to have the participants converge their efforts by working together to crafting a series of statements to use as the brief for the ideation and prototyping phases. ,This activity requires time to think through the research and might take several rounds of refinement.,30 Min,"Clarifying the objective of the design process.
Building consensus within the team.","1. Consolidate the challenges: See how the various challenges identified during earlier discussions or research can be brought together in a single intent statement or Solution Goal.
2. Formulate opportunities: Translate the Solution Goal into a series of possible strategies or Opportunities to move into ideation (you’ll recognise the same HMW statements as used in the Insights and Opportunities activity).
3. Prioritise key opportunity areas: Build consensus around a single Key Opportunity statement or Design Challenge to make sure the team aligns on the direction.","Defining a Design Challenge is an organic process that can be hard to formalise. It is recommended to clearly visualise the thought process even if it may feel a little redundant. 
The ‘Solution Goal’ should capture the intended impact and who it will benefit. To be relevant, any solution brainstormed beyond  this point should directly address the Solution Goal statement.
The ‘Opportunity’ statements will convey possible strategies to leverage in order to meet the Solution Goal using How Might We statements. Some HMWs may have already been created in a previous session, if so those should be taken into account as well.
The ‘Design Challenge’ should be a prioritised Opportunity statement that the team wishes to solution for over the remainder of the exercise.","At the start: Make sure everyone understands the various terms in the template.
During the exercise: Help the participants draw from their previous discussions, this should be an opportunity to reflect on and synthesise existing work rather than finding new ideas.","Does the team have a clear idea of what they are trying to achieve? 
What problem are you solving for and for whom?
What HMWs are you gravitating towards? Why?
Do any other HMWs come to mind?
Are these HMWs actionable? Should they be made more specific or more broad?
Which HMW do you feel is the strongest?
How well does this statement align with your Design Principles?",,,,,
34,HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN,IDEATION,Ideation First Idea + Crazy Idea,"A good warm up to ideation, this activity gets participants to voice and park their crazy ideas to get them out of the way but also to get the rest of the team excited and ready to problem solve further.","This activity is meant to be short fun, consider other ideation formats for longer ideation sessions.",15 Min,"Getting the team to warm up before a longer ideation session.
Getting innovative ideas from the participants.","1. Ideate in groups: This warm-up to the ideation phase can happen in plenary where each participant gets a chance to add new ideas or build on someone else’s. Briefly discuss as a group if the idea should be added to First Idea or Crazy Idea.
2. Unpack the Crazy Ideas: Before wrapping up the exercise, review the Crazy Ideas and see if they inspire new First Ideas to consider.","When facilitating the session, two sheets of paper should be displayed, one with the header ‘First Ideas’ and the other ‘Crazy Idea’ the participants can then come up with concepts in plenary by adding their contributions on sticky notes onto the relevant sheet.
The idea is to encourage lateral thinking, ‘First Ideas’ should consist of ideas that might still be fuzzy or simplistic but ring true to the team in terms of feasibility and desirability.
‘Crazy Ideas’ should consist of playful, funny, moonshot ideas that get everyone excited but won’t be considered beyond this point. These ideas will help participants to break the mold and challenge them to consider radical solutions.","At the start: Make sure the participants understand the flow of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck). 
During the exercise: Get the participants to think big and encourage playful and practical ideas alike.
When summarising: Have participants explain their ideas, and help them to identify interesting points from the ideation session.","Does the team have a clear idea of what they are trying to achieve? 
What problem are you solving for and for whom?
What HMWs are you gravitating towards? Why?",,,,,
35,HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN,IDEATION,SCAMPER,"Ideation can also be about small, incremental tweaks, SCAMPER helps participants explore what those might be through a few simple thought experiments.",This activity is best used when a wide range of ideas have been created and the participants wish to diversify their approach rather than an activity to start from scratch with.,30 Min.,"Finding variations to an early design solution.
Coming up with creative alternative solutions when feeling stuck.","1. Choose an idea: Each person in the team can choose an idea they would like to expand on.
2. Iterate on the idea: Then fill out the template with that idea in mind resulting in seven variations for each concept participants have chosen. ","In the ‘Substituting’ box participants should think of concepts made possible by substituting or changing a certain part of the concept at hand.
In the ‘Combining’ box participants should think of concepts made possible by combining the existing concept with another feature, service, product.
In the ‘Adapting’ box participants should think of concepts made possible by adapting to existing best practices and structures.
In the ‘Modifying’ box participants should think of concept that emphasise or minimise existing features of the existing design.
 In the ‘Putting’ box participants should think of concepts that place the existing solution in a different context or put it to a different use.
In the ‘Eliminating’ box participants should try and remove a feature from the existing solution. 
In the ‘Rearranging’ box participants should try switching the sequence or order things are done in.","At the start: Make sure everyone understands the different boxes in the template.
During the exercise: Have everyone work on their own idea, consider timing the session 3-5 minutes.
When summarising: Have participants share their best outcome and see if they want to do another round.","Does everyone understand the difference between each box?
Which is your favorite idea, can you use it for this exercise?
Is there an idea you feel has potential but isn’t quite there yet? Let’s use that.",,,,,
36,HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN,IDEATION,What If?,The ‘What If Ideation’ tool helps participants come up with new ideas by contextualising current solutions and ideas through different manifestations and forms. This activity can often help come up with ideas that were previously not thought of.,Using a What If activity will be a good warm up but may want to be followed by longer reflection time.,20 Min.,"Making ideation an enjoyable, open-minded exercise.","1. Choose a solution: Review the design challenge, insights, journeys, personas and choose a solution to explore.
2. Don’t Hold Back: Think of as many ideas as you can, and write down whatever comes to mind.","The solution can be phrased in multiple forms or manifestations. ‘Is a physical object or a thing’ is where the solution to the problem or opportunity area takes the form of a physical object or product.
‘A service or process’ sees the solution take the form of a service for the target user or as a process. 
‘A person or a set of people’ sees the solution take the form of a service delivered by a person or a set of people.
‘A digital interaction’ is where the solution takes the form of a digital service which the user interacts with via a digital device.
‘A piece of communication’ is where the solution is in the form of communication material to be consumed by the target user.","At the start: Make sure the participants understand the flow of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck). 
During the exercise: Get the participants to think big and encourage playful and practical ideas alike.
When summarising: Have participants explain their ideas, and help them to identify interesting points from the ideation session.","Can you think of a solution or opportunity in different forms and manifestations? 
Are there any other forms that you can think of that aren’t listed in the template?
Is there anything interesting you can take away from these ideas?
Can you think of anymore out-of-the-box or unconventional ideas?",,,,,
37,HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN,IDEATION,Concept Prioritisation,A set of questions and considerations defined by the team that help prioritise ideas and choose a direction to move forward with.,The questions and considerations should be carefully selected to make sure they cover all of the team's concerns regarding the challenge at hand.,15 Min.,"Building consensus around the ideas to take forward into prototyping. 
To ensure that ideas are compared from several angles.","1. Define the criteria points: Ensure the team agrees on the prioritisation criteria. Edit according to the discussion.
2. Downselect ideas: Choose as a team which ideass to vote on or prioritise. The concepts being voted on should be representative of the various opportunities identified and be diffrent enough from each other to be considered as separate initiatives.
3. Vote on the ideas: Assign values (1-5 or Low, Medium, High) to each idea then tally the votes.
4. Rank and review the ideas: Tally the votes and see which ideas rise to the surface. See if the ranking that emerges properly reflects how the group feels about the ideas.","The requirements in the template are recommendations, any of these can be edited or removed.
'It solves for the problem or opportunity' should assess how well the solution in question is addressing the challenge defined in previous discussions.
'It reflects the  insights and learnings' should assess how well the solution draws from the findings of the research.
'Users will find it desirable' building on the research and persona profiles, the team should assess how relevant and desirable the concept is.
'The team is excited about it' often overlooked, being able to rally a team around a project is key to its success.

An alternative can be to use a simpler 2x2 comparing Urgency and Importance (the axes can always be adapted to the participants' priorities or discussion).","At the start: Make sure the participants have reviewed the questions and agree with them. 
During the exercise: Have the participants agree on how they plan to rate the ideas (number value 1-10? Low, Medium High?).
When summarising: Have participants tally the scores for each idea and help build consensus.","Do the criteria points in the first column work for us? Should we add or remove any?
Will we be able to score the ideas according to these criteria points? Should we use high-medium-low (highest moves forward)  or should we score out of 10? 
How do these scores look to us? Do we agree with this prioritisation? Do we have consensus?
Is there one idea we are excited about taking into prototyping that didn't score the highest?",,,,,
38,HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN,IDEATION,Service Blueprint,A Service Blueprint enables team members to identify the front and back end needs of a service being designed to better assess the logistical needs of any idea.,"Creating a Service Blueprint can be time consuming and tedious, consider using it only after a few ideas have been downselected to move into prototyping.",60 Min.,"Identifying all the moving parts necessary to make the product or service at hand a reality.
Understanding dependencies between user-facing and backend processes.","1. List the steps: Start by creating a sort of Journey Map by identifying all the steps the user will have to go through to meet their needs.
2. Identify supporting processes: Once all the steps hae been clearly listed, break them down into smaller tasks to be completed by the service provider or their external partners.
3. Review the blueprint: Ensure the Blueprint is efficient and meets the need of the user to the best of the team's understanding. Identify any possible vulnerabilities.","The Service Blueprint should cover the full range of interactions a service plans on providing to their customers. At each step or 'Touchpoint' participants should clearly state what the user will do ('User Touchpoints'), what the company or organisation will do ('Service Touchpoints), and what government body, contractor or any external organisation it will rely on for that step ('External actors').
Most Service Blueprints will have three phases: 
'Awareness Building' which refers to any company activity necessary to build the awareness of the customer for the service they are planning on providing (marketing, door to door agents). 
'Service Delivery' should cover the core of the business or organisation's activity.
'Retention' should address how the service plans on engaging customers after their initial use of the service.","At the start: Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the direction. 
During the exercise: make sure participants are identifying all the touchpoints and underlaying processes not just key features of their service.
When summarising: Have participants highlight painpoints and challenges they are overcoming through their service.","Does the experience meet your users' needs?
Were you able to identify all the touchpoints and steps required by the customer experience you are crafting?
Which processes in your blueprint will be handled in-house and which ones will use external resources?
What dependencies can you see in this blueprint? Are they manageable?",,,,,

Quickly formalising the key steps of an experience.","1. Outline the key steps: Start by dicussing as a team the key user interactions.
2.Visualise the touchpoints: For each step consider having a couple frames that clearly convey how the service is being provided. Show any devices, people or spaces necessary to tell the story.","Use as many sheets as necessary to clearly convey the experience.
Describe in words the step illustrated in each frame in the 'Summary' box.","At the start: Make sure the team has a clear understanding of the key steps of their service.
During the exercise: Make sure participants are being detailed enough in conveying how the service is being delivered.
When summarising: Have participants present the Storyboard to another group and see if it is self-explanatory.","Which concept do you feel most strongly about? Can you unpack it into a series of steps?
Can you walk me through your Storyboard? What is the connection between these two frames? How did the user get there?
