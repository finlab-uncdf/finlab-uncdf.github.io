1,"STRATEGY, INNOVATION & IMPACT",VISION BUILDING,Startup Canvas,The canvas summarises the most important elements of an organisation's business model and is especially useful for early stage startups. The version of the canvas being used here is inspired by the Lean methodology and business model canvas.,The canvas tool is not a problem solving tool as such. It has limited capacity to answer what the ‘right’ model for a business is. It is best used as an evolving summary or dashboard. ,90-120 Min,"Investigating and mapping how ideas or solutions could be transformed into a holistic business model. 
Mapping current business models, identifying gaps and opportunities (priorities), and outlining interdependencies. 
Using the canvas as a dashboard to document each stage of evolution of the business model, and reflecting on investments and results.","Familiarise yourself: Read through the various boxes in the Startup Canvas, you'll notice the left two columns have to do with internal activity and the two to the right refer to external forces.
Get started: As a business, what do you have most clarity on? Is it your understanding of your customer segment or of the needs your are addressing through your business? Use these questions to decide which side of the canvas to start on.
Complete: Go through each box and fill out as much as you can. It is completely fine not to know the answer to specific areas.
Identify Knowledge Gaps: Once the worksheet is completed to the best your knowledge, jot down in a different color remaining knowledge gaps. Do you have clear revenue streams? Do you have strong metrics to track your progress?","The ‘Problem’ section is to be used to highlight the core problems that users face and that the startup is attempting to solve, not those that the startup is facing as an organisation. 
‘Customer Segments’ requires the startup to identify the specific profile of the users for whom the problem is most acutely felt. Profiles can be very specific and also quantised in terms of segments/market size. 
'solution’ is how the startup plans to address the problem - it could be a product, service, system or a combination of them. 
‘Unfair Advantage’ is the distinct, hard to copy competitive advantage the startup enjoys. 
‘Unique Value Proposition’ is the core compelling message for the user that communicates the value the startup is creating for them. 
‘Channels’ are the ways in which the user will interact with the solution. These could include ways that users will become of the solution, experience it for the first time, purchase and continue to use. 
‘Key Metrics’ are the ways the business can measure its success. These could include impressions, downloads, sign ups, transactions, value of transactions, renewals etc. 
‘Cost Structure’ is the way the costs are distributed between fixed and variable, and capital investments and operational costs. 
‘Revenue Streams’ are the ways in which revenue is to be generated - whether its one time, subscription, loyalty fees etc.","At the start: Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).
During the exercise: Start with participants’ existing knowledge of their business to create a first version of the model. Encourage the participants to highlight any component the participants don't know the answer to for later reference. 
When summarising: Have participants walk you through the canvas they have created and probe on what is their core strengths and weaknesses they would like to build upon. ","Which part of the business do you have the best view on? What are you least informed on?
Is there anything in here you'd like to understand better? Eg. customer segment, value proposition, etc. 
Do you expect your fundamental model and this canvas to change in the next 6 months?
Can you think of any other things you‘d like to add to this canvas? Are there any links between boxes you‘d like to call out?
Did challenges shared as part of the startup journey resonate with you? Which did you think was most relevant for your company?
What are your company's goals in the next 3-6-12 months? Are you considering them as you map your priorities?
How do you know something is a priority? Is there understanding within your company that these are the top priorities and challenges, or is there some assumption involved?
Do your priorities depend on each other? Are there 1-2 core priorities at the root of all the different challenges you might be facing?",,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvIN9STpzCQ,Lean Canvas | Railsware
2,"STRATEGY, INNOVATION & IMPACT",VISION BUILDING,Ten Types of Innovation,The Ten Types of Innovation framework is a tool developed by consulting firm Doblin. It maps the fundamental types of innovations that are relevant to organisations and helps the them look at innovation as a holistic activity that can involves internal as well as customer facing investments. Supporting each type are some classical tactics.,"While the Ten Types of Innovation tool is fairly comprehensive, it may be possible that an organisation is looking to offer innovations that are composite of the different types. Also, the tactics listed may not cover some new trends and tactics that teams may need to scan and map. ",90-120 Min,"Mapping the types of innovation that are currently being offered by an organisation. 
Identifying strengths and weaknesses with regards to innovation at an organisation. 
Identifying new types of innovation that an organisation can consider. ","Familiarise yourself: Read through the various boxes of the Ten Types of Innovation. Note down what you think is the biggest differentiator in terms of innovation for the business. 
Top Level Innovation: At the level of Configuration, Offering, and Experience - begin by noting down what makes the business innovative currently. If you have thoughts on what could potentially be future innovations note them down as well. 
Review the Tactics: Read through the tactics under each type of innovation using the ‘Tactics Cheat Sheet‘
Ten Types of Innovation: Next, at the level of each type of innovation, note down what makes the business innovative currently. Follow that by noting down potential innovations to explore in the future.
Review & Brainstorm: Review the mapping of current and potential innovations. Based on the Ten Types, refine the view at the top level. Brainstorm how the potential innovations could be approached."," ‘Configuration‘: Innovation that focuses on how your organisation is set up and structured. The types of innovation that fall under this category include:
Profit Model: Innovating how you make money - how revenue, costs and profits are organised. 
Network: Innovating who you innovate with - how suppliers, partners, and external innovators help.
Structure: Innovating how you organise and align your organisation, talent and assets to create more value - how departments, units, business lines etc. are organised.
Process: Innovating with a signature and superior methods internally - how quality management, production, supply systems, procurement, leadership systems, hiring etc. help in innovation.
 ‘Offering‘: Innovations, that are directly focused on the nature of products or services that are offered to your customers or stakeholders. The types that are in this category are:
Product Performance: Innovating products and services that work better to deliver superior value to buyers - unique product features and functionality that help do more, with more style, speed, safety, ease, fun etc. 
Product System: Innovating by creating complementary products and services that connect or bundle together to create more value - accessories, platforms, services, discounts and pricing etc. 
 ‘Experience‘: Innovations that concentrate on how products or services are delivered to and experienced by customers and users. The types under this category are:
Service: Innovating by adding value in how you support customers find, buy, pay, enjoy and dispose of your product - trials, personalisation, delivery and returns, financing, self-service, warranties, repairs etc. 
Channel: Innovating how you deliver your offerings to customers and users - pop-up stores, e-commerce stores, partner stores, events, experience stores etc.
Brand: Innovating how you present your offerings and business in a distinctive, memorable, and likeable way - co-branding, own-label, certification, marketing campaigns, brand extensions, packaging, identity etc. 
Customer Engagement: Innovating how you enable user interactions - personalised, rewarding, ‘humanised‘, listening to customers, collaboration, connect users to communities etc.","At the start: Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).
During the exercise: Start with a discussion focused on what kinds of innovation are possible. Take teams through the Ten Types tool, and ask them to fill the worksheet - mapping currently adopted innovation, gaps and opportunities, and potential ideas. 
When summarising: Have participants walk you through the worksheet they have filled out and probe them on their mapping of the current innovations and their ideas for things they can try out.","What do you understand from the word ‘innovation‘? How do your organisations look at innovation?
Is your organisation currently innovating in terms of configuration, offering, or experience - or a combination of these? What is the most crucial innovation you have?
What is the biggest gap in terms of innovation for your organisation? How do you compare to your closest competitors?
In terms of configuration - have you looked at internal processes and structures before or have you focused only on external facing innovations?
In terms of Offering and Experience - what do you know about what your customers need? Are your innovations tuned to customer needs?
Have you gone through the tactics? Can you identify those you have been practicing? Is there anything missing that you want to make a note of? 
Which tactics have you considered with earlier and chosen not to go forward with? Which tactics are new to you, and you could potentially try out?
Are the innovations that you could experiment with - incremental or transformational?",,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKvhhqGJ80U,Ten Types of Innovation | Deloitte US
3,"STRATEGY, INNOVATION & IMPACT",VISION BUILDING,Product Roadmap,Roadmapping is an important step of clarifying the direction of a startup or programme over the next few years. It helps the team align on which challenges to prioritise and the ideal path moving forward.,"Created for and by the Startup community this format may feel a little tedious, participants should feel comfortable adapting the template to their needs.",60-90 Min,"Building consensus on the company or programme's strategic direction. 
Identifying key milestones and responsibilities of each team. 
Formulating an actionable plan for the team to work towards.","Familiarise yourself: Review the Startup Canvas, you'll notice the left two columns have to do with internal activity and the two to the right refer to external forces.

Identify Knowledge Gaps: Once the worksheet is completed to the best your knowledge, jot down in a different color remaining knowledge gaps. Do you have clear revenue streams? Do you have strong metrics to track your progress?","The ‘Team’ column refers to any team involved in the process of developing each phase and clearly identifying key roles and responsibilities. Teams can include marketing, developers, strategy or any other arm of the practice involved in the development of the product or the program. 
‘POC’ or Proof Of Concept is the first tangible version of the concept. It should validate assumptions regarding the functionality and desirability of the product without necessarily having resolved all the technical issues with it.
‘MVP’ short for Minimum Viable Product, refers to the earliest version of a digital product, it is a streamlined version of the service or product (only contains key, necessary features) used to understand where the core of the business opportunity lies. 
‘Alpha’ is the first release with actual users in a controlled environment like a Focus Group Discussion (FGD). This allows for feedback from real users without having to resolve all the bugs or technical challenges behind the product or service.
‘Beta’ is the first public release used to gather feedback from a wide array of users.
‘Launch’ milestones should cover any final challenges regarding going to market like landing strategic partnerships or additional features to be integrated based on feedback on previous iterations.
'success Metrics’ should be defined based on the goals and milestones set for each phase of development, these are metrics used to validate assumptions and to make a case for continuing the development of the project all along the way.","At the start: Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).
During the exercise: Help participants understand where they stand on the roadmap and if any edits should be made to the template. 
When summarising: Make sure clear milestones have been formulated, and encourage participants to get input from representatives of the teams listed in the roadmap that may not have been available for the activity. ","Are you familiar with this format? Do you have your own version in your organisation?
How far are you currently on this roadmap? Should anything on here be changed?

5,"STRATEGY, INNOVATION & IMPACT",VISION BUILDING,Theory of Change,Theory of Change (TOC) is a framework that attempts to map how desired change is being achieved through intended activities and investments. It also helps participants differentiate between results and impact. The framework is useful in calibrating strategy - especially in the social impact and development sector. ,"While the TOC helps layout an overall strategy, there is little guarantee that activities and resources will eventually translate into impact on ground. TOCs are often revisited and refined as results from the real world emerge.",90-120 Min,"Creating an end to end summary of the intended impact strategy of a programme or business when conceptualising it. 
Diagnosing and reflecting on actual impact and to finetune a strategy. In the world of impact investing, the TOC is used to understand how innovators may create greater impact via the investments they may be seeking. ","Define a vision: Discuss with the team what the intended impact of the program or service should be.
Unpack the necessary resources: First fill in the left side of the tool to establish the basic financial, staff, staff and network resources needed to roll out the programme.
Link the efforts to the impact: Then link these resources and activities to outputs and outcomes that will lead to the impact you defined in the first step.
Identify blindspots: Before ending the session, review the template and look for assumptions you might be making about each step or how they link to each other.","The ‘Resources & Inputs’ section is to meant to park the human, knowledge, skill, financial, technological, infrastructural, systemic capabilities that are required by an innovator or entrepreneur as they look to create impact. 
‘Activities’ are those tasks that the resources will help undertake. The nature of these tasks could be both user facing (awareness building, onboarding, servicing etc.) and internal (process development, skill building, hiring, technology adoption etc.) - although the former is of higher priority. Investors needs to be clear that the resources are being spent on priority activities.  
‘Outputs’ are the most basic numbers and metrics that will help measure the quantity of results from the investment into resources and activities. Without going into whether the efforts were successful or not, the outputs help understand the extent of effort (for example - number of people reached, campaigns undertaken, number of learning sessions held etc.) 
‘Outcomes’ are deeper metrics than outputs and start focusing on both the quantity and quality of results. The focus is most importantly on short-medium term impact metrics (for example - number and type of conversions from those reached, level of awareness in people because of campaign, skills built in people because of learning sessions etc.) 
‘Impact’ focuses on longer term results and change. The section focuses on real, lasting impact created by the interventions. The meaningfulness of the outcomes and outputs is really brought to fore here (for example - conversions influencing behaviour, awareness leading to better decision making and choice, skills leading to ability to sustain financially etc.)
‘Assumptions’ are risk factors that the innovator is not quite sure of as the TOC is being built. They need to be validated as the TOC is iterated on.","At the start: Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck). 
During the exercise: Start with participants’ existing knowledge of their activity to create a first version of the map.

12,HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN,FOUNDATION,Problem Tree + 5 Whys,"Problem Tree is a tool used to identify effects and causes of a given challenge. The aim is to repeatedly unpack each symptom until one reaches a “root cause” or unexpected angle from which to think of the problem. While traditionally the tool is looked only through a problem lens, it can also use it to appreciate opportunities. 5 Whys are an activity that can be run during the Problem Tree to help participants get to the root cause of the topic.",The Problem Tree does not give any indication of the magnitude or the importance of the causes of the problem or opportunity area. It may also be difficult to understand the effects and causes right from the beginning and may require a few iterations of this activity.,60 Min,"Reframing a problem or topic to make sure the way the problem is understood by the group is the best way to look at it.
Uncovering unexpected opportunities in the space a team or organisation is working in.","State the problem: Start by drawing a tree trunk, label it with the main problem or opportunity that you are looking to work on.
List the effects: It's often easier to get started by listing the visible effects of the the problem at hand and then trying to identify the more indirect impact the problem might have.
List the causes: Start listing what the team sees as the causes for the given problem or opportunity statement. Again, try to identify indirect causes for the problem at hand.
Dig deeper: To really get into the depth (or root cause) keep asking why each cause exists until you feel that you have a strong enough root cause.","The ‘Problem/Opportunity’ section should be something specific that has been chosen to be investigated. This could be the problem faced by the user, or an opportunity area defined by the startup (this can be taken from the problems listed in the Startup Canvas) or organisation.
The ‘Effects’ are what happens as a result of the problem. These symptoms should be written in the branches of the tree. For example, if the problem is defined as ‘Poor Public Transport‘, then an effect would probably be, ‘Commuter getting late to work‘, or ‘Expensive private transport options’.
The ‘Causes’ are the reasons why the problem causes the effects. The aim is to write down as many clear and concise reasons in the roots of the tree. Following up on the same example, the root cause of ‘Poor Public Transport’ could probably be, ‘Inadequate public funding’ or ‘Poor route planning’.
The levels to which the ‘Effects’ and the ‘Causes’ can be unpacked will vary depending on the understanding the team has of the topic at hand. There is no pressure to be exhaustive - it is meant to start the planning process - not to complete the analysis. 
 The Problem Tree provides a visual breakdown of problems into their symptoms as well as their causes, and furthermore create a visual output that can be understood by anyone.","At the start: Explain the activity to the participants, preferably using examples. Make sure they first write down the effects and then the causes.
During the exercise: Ensure that the participants don‘t get stuck or fixate on a single train of thought.
When summarising: Have participants share their root causes and talk through their process of getting to the root cause.","What are the most immediate causes and effects you can think of as a group?
Have we gone deep enough? Can we unpack this effect / cause further?
Why does [cause] happen? Can we list those reasons as well as sub causes?

Reorganise groups: Once the stakeholders are listed, review their placement on the map with the team. There might be disagreements regarding which circle a stakeholder might fit in or the reach of their influence.
Call out dynamics: The last step will be to draw connections between the stakeholders to understand their relationships. In doing so, new stakeholders should emerge. ","The ‘Target User’ section is to be kept focused on individuals or groups that the startup or organisation is trying to solution for. 
‘Direct Influencers’ are those that most influence the attitudes and behaviours of the target audience. One can look at these influencers as those with only one degree of separation. For example - college students may be influenced by their peers, the retail ecosystem around them, college authorities and even their parents in their choice of a fintech solution. 
‘Indirect Influencers’ are those that somewhat influence the target audience but their impact is left direct. There are two or more degrees of separation between the target and these stakeholders. For example - looking again at college students, such influencers might be administrators, state legislation, scholarship funds etc. 
'societal Norms’ are the forces that may not have a direct representative but are still important to take into account.

Follow-up questions: Follow-up questions help you dig deeper behind specific aspects of the stories to understand the motivations that drive the respondents and the challenges they face.","For a smooth interview, the interviewer should prepare a simple Discussion Guide. This will help them keep track of the discussion and ensure all the intended topics are covered. Such a guide should be prepared by the interviewer and their team, it can me a couple bullet points for more experienced interviewers or clearly written out questions for new learners.
The ‘Personal Introduction’ helps set the tone of the interview and establish mutual respect. If the session is to be recorded this is a good time to request consent from the respondent.

Identify misfit cards: If it is felt the cards don't fit into any particular category - then keep them aside and come back to them later.","The ‘Category/Level/Preference/Stage’ is the section where the researcher needs to decide what is being mapped. Is it preference (for example - out of multiple features on an online commerce site - what is prefered?), sequence (for example - what should be on the home page and what should follow?), or just a matter of simple categorisation (for example - these features represent the known and these are new)? The categories can be defined by the researcher (closed sort) or left to the user (open sort). It is ideal to start with defined categories.  
‘Attributes/Topics/Events’ are the content factors that are used to populate the cards. These are ideally represented by visuals and supporting descriptions. Sometimes researchers also use cards that are just text based (adjectives, verbs, emotions etc.). The researcher has the option of creating multiple versions (for example - multiple login screen options) of a card in case the idea is to capture preference. 
The researcher is responsible for setting the context and then letting the respondent move forward with the exercise. As the card sorting is taking place, the researcher can ask questions and engage in conversation. For this, the researcher must be confident of why individual cards are part of the bundle - what they represent and what their sorting in particular categories could mean in terms of insights. 
The exercise can be used as a tool for exploration or for definition and decision making. Although it is better suited as for exploration and needs to be supported with more in-depth conversations.

This could be in terms of decades/months/weeks (for example - 1990s, 2000s, 2010s) or even life stages (for example - childhood/teenage/youth). The choice of time frames is flexible and to be decided by the researcher. 
 ‘What?’ is the section in which participants’ inputs on objects/events/actions/behaviours/beliefs that best fit into a particular time period are noted down (for example - music in the 90s was about the Sony Walkman, in the 2000s it was about the iPod, in 2010s all music was on smartphones).
‘Where?’ is the section in which the input from the participant is focused on description of location - physical spaces/ geographies/sectors/internet that can add some further context to the ‘What?’ section (for example - music in the 90s was about the local music store and music at cafes, in 2000s about iTunes and pirated MP3 collections, and in the 2010s about streaming platforms like Spotify).

Translate into Insights: Insights can feel very ambiguous, it is important to leave time to find ways to clearly formulate what the research will inform the next steps of the process by translating them into insights.
Expand into Opportunities: In order to ease the transition into problem solving, How Might We statements can be used to identify possible strategies or objectives to strive for.","The purpose of this activity is to translate findings or ‘Key Takeaways’ into consolidated ‘Insights’ and ‘Opportunities’. To do so, the team will pull from their affinity mapping exercise to identify valuable takeaways. Those will be written in the ‘Key Takeaways’ box.
Related takeaways might then form a new understanding of the context at hand or of the user's needs. These should be captured as ‘Insights’. There are two parts to an insight, a support statement which explains how the team's findings inform a new understanding of the context at hand by bringing together in a single sentence the situation observed, the challenges faced by the users and the user's perspective on the matter. Together they should represent a new understanding the team has derived from those. This support statement can then be summarised into a crisper statement that will become the insight statement.
Insights are by definition intended to be enlightening, however they can be challenging to translate into ‘Opportunities’.

30,HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN,DEFINE,Attribute Scale,"Attribute Scale is a method that helps measure and compare people's’ needs, attitudes and experiences about products, services, experiences, concepts etc. The method uses a set of scales for measurement defined by two opposite ends, such as for service presence - “physical” and “digital,” for price “affordable” and “premium,” for brand communication “subtle” and “loud” etc. Different people's preferences are mapped and then compared. Patterns of are analyzed for insights and opportunities.","The Attribute Scale is useful when teams have a robust sense of the comparison that they plan to map, and also have a consensus on how scores on each attribute are decided.

Attributes, Scale & Entities: Make a list of attributes that are the most important to map. Decide what scale extremes are relevant for each of the attributes. Next decide on the entities that need to be mapped on the scale. 
Map Scores: Go attribute by attribute and map each entity on the scales defined. Connect scores on each attribute to create a visual mapping. 
Review Patterns & Discuss: Review the patterns that are emerging across the different entities and discuss how they inform the insights.","Attributes are the key qualities/ features/ propositions/needs towards which the preference or inclination of the entities (users, competitors, products etc.) need to be mapped - purchasing power, pricing needs, communication frequency, digitisation, influence, size, convenience, ease of use etc. are some examples of such attributes. 
Scale is the way to measure the preference or inclination of these attributes. Typically these can be represented by two extremes points (low-high). Another way to express the extremes is in terms of opposites (for example - physical or digital).
Entities are the things or people that need to be compared. These could be users (young, middle age, old customers), competitors (small companies, established companies), products, services, systems, geographies etc. Comparison between the entities helps the designer arrive at patterns and insights.
Scores are essentially the point on an attribute scale that is deemed to be appropriately representing a particular entity. 
Score lines are the lines connecting the different scores on the scales - creating a visual path/representation that can be used for comparison between one entity and another. 
Patterns are the visual commonalities or divergences that emerge once the mapping of scores and score lines has been completed. ","At the start: Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).

Typically A/B/n testing is used to test two or more variations of a product or service at a broad level. Especially at the concept and prototype level
Or test two or more variations of specific components, journeys, features etc. for a product or service - closer to production and launch. ","Familiarise yourself: Read through the template and discuss the testing requirements. Note down the purpose of the test and key metrics. 
Versions, Format & Scope: Note down the format that the test would take and the kind of assets that would need to be developed (if not done already). Make a note of how each of the versions differ from each other. 
Identify Tester Profile: Note down the kind of testers and users the testing will be focused on. Profiles, segments, groups etc. can be mentioned here along with the sample size.
Conduct the Test: Use the tool as guidance as you go about the test. The test will require an additional script (steps, tasks etc) that will depend on your choice of format, scope, and profile. 
Test Learnings & Review: Once the tests are done - note down the results and learnings in this section. If a version meets the purpose - move ahead. Otherwise, discuss iteration of versions and further testing needs. ","The ‘Purpose of Test’ section is meant for you to note down the key reason for which the test is being conducted - to understand broad preference, to seek adoption, to test a new version etc. 
The ‘Key Metrics of Success/Failure’ box is meant to note down the key metrics based on which test results will be evaluated on - interest, time spent on page, signup, purchase, revenues, rating score etc. 
‘Testing Formats’ is the section in which the key format of the test assets and experiment have to be described - visual concepts and prototypes, interactive screens, in production assets etc. The test may involve actual use that can be recorded, or it may just involve an interview where feedback is collected. 
‘Testing Scope’ is the section in which the designer has to define how each of the versions are different from each other - along with rationale on why the differences are relevant. This would include specifying constants across the versions, as well as variables in each version. Based on one round of testing, iterations can be developed and tested again. 
‘Tester Profile’ is the section in which the designer needs to identify who the different versions are to be tested with. Usually, in A/B testing there is a ‘Control’ group that a base version is tested with, and ‘Treatment’ groups with which different versions are tested. The different types (for example - existing customers, loyal customers, not customers) of users have to be defined based on the purpose, format and scope of the test. Tests are typically considered valid if different groups of a single user type test all versions (for example - existing customers groups 1,2,n testing version A, B, n). Tests can also be valid if different versions are tested with one group of one type (for example - group 1 of existing customers test version A,B,n). Tests are invalid if different versions are tested with different types of users ( for example - A with existing, B with loyal, C with not customers) as relevant comparisons cannot be made. 
‘Test Learnings’ is the section in which one is to note down the results of testing - in terms of results (in terms of metrics) achieved or just a collation of the feedback received from testers. ","At the start: Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).
During the exercise: Start with a discussion on testing approaches that each of the teams have used before. Walk through the tool and its components. Discuss why testing is required and what is the most crucial aspect to test. Connect back to the prototypes that people may have created already. 
When summarising: Have participants walk you through the worksheet they have filled out. Probe them on their final testing plans, versions and approaches","What are some testing approaches you may have used before? Does anyone know what A/B/n testing is?

47,BEHAVIOURS & DESIGN,TOOLS,NUDGE,"The NUDGE framework is a set of principles that help designers influence choices or decisions made by people. The guiding theme of the framework is while people should have the freedom to make their own choices, but should also be provided assistance that allows them to make better decisions. The approach is broadly called ‘Choice Architecture’.","The NUDGE Framework is best used to influence moments where people are making a clear choice/decision. It may not be suited to changing ingrained attitudes and behaviors that may not have clear ‘choice moments’.
",60-90 Min,"Helping people make better decisions while interacting with a product or service. 
Have multiple choices and do not fully appreciate the true costs and benefits of their actions. 
Struggle with genuinely complex choices that require a high degree of reflection, fact finding, analysis etc.
Make decisions that are rare in nature and are not informed by their own experiences.
Need feedback on their current decisions to understand them better. ","Familiarise yourself: Read through the various boxes in the NUDGE template. At the top is where the choice/decision that is the focus is to be noted. 
Get started: Start by calling out the persona of the target user (you can use an previously filled out persona template). Go through the NUDGE actions thereafter. Fill the middle column first, and then go to the right side. 
Complete: Note down your thoughts and ideas on what each of the NUDGE actions could be under the relevant boxes in the rightmost column. 
Prioritise: Once the worksheet is completed, discuss and prioritise ideas that could be experimented with. You could a single or multiple nudges. ","The ‘Choice/Decision Moment’ section is meant for you to note down the key action/moment that is being focused on. You can call out what is happening current in the ‘Current Choice/Decision’ box, and the action you are intending to generate in the ‘Desired Choice/Decision’ box. 
The ‘User/Stakeholder Persona/Profile’ box is meant to note down the key attributes - needs, attitudes, behaviors etc. that can help bring the user in sharp focus. A prefilled persona template (in case available) can be used instead of doing this again. 
‘Investigate INcentives’ is the section in which you look at what could be incentives that could be the NUDGE solution. Incentives can be monetary, social, effort etc. It is important to first note down all incentives that you think are relevant before choosing the ones to be explored further. The idea is that the right incentives can influence the choice if communicated/offered to the user.
‘Understand Choices’ is the section in which the costs vs. benefits of the different choices before the user/stakeholder are to be first mapped - and then a decision taken on how these trade offs are to be communicated. The theory is that communicating these trade offs to users helps them choose better. 
‘Consider Defaults’ is the section in which the designer evaluates default settings on the product or service that can help users make the right decision. The theory is that users can benefit from default that are closely linked to the desired choice. 
‘Give Feedback’ is the section in which one has to consider points in the choice/decision at which feedback would help the user make the right choice. The designer has to consider what this feedback is and when it should be provided. 
‘Expect Errors’ is the section in which the designer should consider accommodating the most common errors made by the user while choosing/deciding so that they don‘t impact the overall quality of choice.","At the start: Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).
During the exercise: Start with participants’ discussing the prospect of influencing choice and instances where their own choices/decisions could have been improved by the right inputs. Go through the NUDGE framework step by step.

48,BEHAVIOURS & DESIGN,TOOLS,SWITCH Framework,"The Switch Framework is widely used to guide behaviour change approaches - especially in the behavior change communication domain. Similar to the NUDGE framework, it goes beyond complex choices and focuses on what it takes to create sustainable behaviour change. The model proposes that there are three elements of behaviour of a person - the rational side (The Rider), the emotion side ( The Elephant), and the environment (The Path). To change behavior one has to focus all three aspects. ","While the SWITCH model is great in terms of highlighting the different aspects of how behavior change can be approached, it is upto the designer to define how these aspects will come together in terms of a campaign or program. ",60-90 Min,"Identify how a product or service might be able to achieve behaviour change. 
Identify how behaviour change may be realised in the use of a product or service.
Identify a communication or advertising strategy for a behavior change initiative. ","Familiarise yourself: Read through the various boxes in the SWITCH template. At the top is where the current behaviour and the desired behavior are to be noted first.
Get started: Start with the Rider and map out ideas and thoughts under each of the three sub aspects. Follow the same process for Elephant and Rider. The ideas should be focused on that specific aspect. 
Refine & Review: See how the different aspects are connected to each other. Refine and review in terms of whether it is realistic to bring all things together. "," ‘Direct The Rider‘: Behavior change can happen when we provide a crystal clear direction to the rational side (The Rider) of a person who is to adopt a behavior. To be able to appeal to the rational side, one can:
Follow The Bright Spots: Build on existing positive behaviour and success stories rather than focusing all the energy on fixing the problematic areas. Learn from, and scale positives. 
Script the Critical Moves: Dissolve the resistance by breaking down the big picture into specific behaviours that people can be asked to focus on. 
Point to the Destination: Create a specific clear goal that people can work towards and respond to - something that is inspirational and relevant.
‘Motivate The Elephant‘: It is critical to engage a person's emotion side (The Elephant) to be able to achieve sustainable behavior change. To appeal to people's emotion side, one can:
Find the Feeling: Make people feel something that inspires them to change. Try and focus on positive motivation rather than just negative reinforcement. 
Shrink The Change: Break down the change until it no longer seems daunting. Lay a path from a simple first step to long term change in as small steps as possible. 
Grow Your People: Identify skills, knowledge, resources, tools, rewards etc. that can help enable behavior change. 
'shape The Path‘: When one changes the situation/environment/ context (The Path), often it makes it easier for the Rider and Elephant to follow. To be able to create an enabling environment, one can:
Tweak the Environment: Change elements in the physical environment that are current bottlenecks or introduce new elements that can enable desired behavior. 
Build Habits: Look for ways to convert behaviour change into habits by enabling repetition of desired behaviors. 
Rally the Herd: Get change recognised and adopted by other people - it helps build support and momentum.","At the start: Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).
During the exercise: Start with participants’ existing understanding of the current behaviors being displayed and the behavior change desired. Move to each section thinking of the rational (Rider), emotional (Elephant), and environment (Path) dimensions of behavior change.

49,BEHAVIOURS & DESIGN,TOOLS,Hook Model,"The Hook Model is a tool used to encourage habitual use of products, services and systems by users. It is based on the hypothesis that habitual use is realised if users are taken through a cyclical journey that includes - triggers (things that get the user to come to the product/service), actions (the interaction of user with the product/service), rewards (the benefits for the user upon use), and investment (the commitment realised by use of product/service over time). ",The HOOK model was developed based on learnings of user behavior on online platforms and social networking sites. It therefore may seem sometimes come across as a limited framework in cases where technology may not be involved.,90-120 Min,"Identify a strategy to encourage users to come back to a product or service after they have used it for the first time.

Identify a strategy to encourage habits and repeated behavior in any context.","Familiarise yourself: Read through the various boxes of the HOOK Model and consider how these may apply to the current or proposed product/ service solution.
First Time/New User: You may begin by thinking of how a first time or new user is being taken through the steps. You may begin by mapping the current journey and then identify gaps.
Existing Users: Next, you may think of an existing user or a repeat user who can potentially stay with the product or service for a long time. You can begin by mapping current journey and then identify gaps. 
Brainstorm & Discuss: Based on the gaps identified for new and current users, you may next identify potential solutions to try out. These ideas can be discussed as a team or a group.","‘Triggers:’ Things that get users to interact with and use a product/service for the first time, and then keep coming back over time. There are two major types of triggers - external and internal. 
‘External Triggers:’ Triggers that are focused on marketing and advertising vehicles that bring users on board. The main types being:
Paid Triggers: Advertising, search engine marketing, and other paid channels are commonly used to get users’ attention and prompt them to act. Paid triggers can be effective but costly ways to keep users coming back.
Earned Triggers: Earned triggers are free in that they cannot be bought directly, but they often require investment in the form of time spend on public and media relations, Favourable press mentions, hot viral videos, and featured app store placements are all effective ways to gain attention. 
Relationship Triggers: One person telling others about a product or service can be a highly effective external trigger. Whether through electronic invitations, a Facebook like and share, or just simple word of mouth - referrals from friends and family are a key reason for adoption. Relationship triggers can create viral hyper-growth for offerings. 
Owned Triggers: Triggers that consistently show up in the user's use space - an app icon, a notification, a daily email update etc. These triggers are only set after users sign up for an account, submit their contact details, install an app etc. 
Internal Triggers: Emotions (such as boredom, confusion, loneliness, indecision, stress), routines, and thoughts that function as prompts for users. The deep association of a product/service with such triggers can drive users towards a product or service. 
‘Action:’ The ways in which the user's interaction with the product/service can be eased. The aim is to enhance ease of use with regards to six main elements - 
Time: The amount of time it takes to complete an action. 
Money: The monetary cost of taking an action. 
Physical effort: The amount of labour involved in taking an action. 
Brain cycles: The level of mental effort and focus required to take an action. 
Social deviance: The level of acceptance an action has from others.
Non-routine: The level to which the action matches or disrupts existing routines. 
‘Variable Rewards:’ Variable rewards are defined as rewards that vary with time and are somewhat unpredictable - helping keep the novelty of the user experience, and creating engagement. There are three fundamental types of rewards that a product/service can be associated with:
Reward of the Tribe: Rewards fuelled by the need to be connected to, accepted, recognised, admired, respected etc. by other people. 
Reward of the Hunt: Rewards fuelled by the need to acquire physical products/material resources, and information.
Reward of the Self: Rewards fuelled by ‘intrinsic motivations’ focused on self development and growth such as the need to acquire a sense of mastery, competence, or completion. 
‘Investment:’ The more users invest time and effort into a product or service, the more they value it. The different forms in which users can become invested in a product/service include:
Content: The collection of memories and experiences, in aggregate, becomes more valuable over time and a product/ service becomes harder to leave as users’ personal investment grows. 
Data: The more information users share and link with a product or service, the more committed they become to it. 
Network: The more invested users’ are in a network of people - as a follower, a friend, as someone with followers - the less likely they are to abandon a product or service and start over.
Reputation: The reputation that users build or earn over time makes them stay invested over long periods of time. 
Skill: Once users have invested the effort to acquire a skill, they are less likely to switch to a competing product. ","At the start: Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).
During the exercise: Start with a discussion focused on why habit forming products and services are important. Walk them through the tool, and then move along the cycle from triggers to investment. Teams can be asked to map what they do currently, identify gaps and think of new ways they can look at the steps. 
When summarising: Have participants walk you through the worksheet they have filled out and probe them on their mapping of the current and their ideas for things they can try out.","What are you solving for? Is that important enough for users to keep coming back?
Who are you trying to create sticky products and services for? - - - Why is habitual use important for your product/service if at all?

50,BEHAVIOURS & DESIGN,TOOLS,Gamification Board,"Gamified Board is a tool to help designers think through the application of gamification principles in their product or service design solutions. The board summaries the classical elements of gamification and works as an ideation framework. Gamification is a technique that borrows from approaches that game designers use to engage players, and applies these approaches to non-game experiences to motivate actions. Gamification is all about enhancing engagement of users and usually used as a front end layers that works in tandem with core product or service features. 
",Gamification is often mistakenly taken as a comprehensive answer to all customer engagement needs. It is only one type of approach. It should be used sparingly and thoughtfully. It does not guarantee better customer engagement in itself - especially if the core value proposition and features are weak. ,60-90 Min,"The Gamified Board can be used to define a new service or product experience with gamified elements as a way to differentiate user experience.

Points, Badges & Leaderboards: List out when, why and how many points and badges will be awarded to users for completing missions, levels, and tasks. Outline how leaderboards and dashboards will be used to inform users.
Review & Discuss: Review the game concept that can be developed on the board. Discuss if the concept is exciting and how it can be translated into prototypes and testable assets. ","‘Broad Goal’ is the strategic reason gamification is being chosen as a strategy - increasing engagement, forming habits, differentiating experience etc. could be some such goals to consider. It could also be defined as what you want the user to accomplish, for example - sound financial planning. 
‘Game Dynamics’ are some of the specific goals that gamification would help achieve and that can be the guiding elements for levels and tasks. Among these are:
Competition: Creating a sense of competition amongst users could help achieve the broad goal. At individual and team level, competition could help accelerate use and increase engagement. 
Collaboration: When creating a sense of community and collaboration helps achieve the broad goal. Important to consider who the collaboration is between and what it helps achieve that individuals can‘t.
Progress & Achievement: The journey/path that signifies growth and evolution for individuals and teams. 
Exploration and Surprise: Complimenting progress could be aspects that enhance the sense of exploration and adventure for overall game engagement. 
‘Game Mechanics’ are specific tactics that help realise the game dynamics and goal. 
Missions: Missions are journeys that bring the sense of progress alive. They help navigate users towards a desired end state. For example - financial planning could be broken down into short term, mid term and long term missions. 
Levels: Levels are stages in which mission are broken down. For example - short term financial planning may mean creating levels such as - basic, adequate, well planned, excellent. 
Tasks: Specific activities within missions that are closely tied to the overall purpose of gamification. For example - planning in the short term may mean investing in certain kinds of deposits, insurance, equity funds etc. 
Points: Points help keep score and establish status in terms of progress. For example - each investment in financial products could fetch points (real or virtual) for user.
Badges: An indicator of accomplishment that goes beyond points. For example as a financial planner - someone who invests regularly could get a badge saying ‘responsible investor’. 
Leaderboards: They help bring the sense of competition alive by showing the progress vis a vis other users/players.","At the start: Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).
During the exercise: Start with a discussion on gamification and the teams’ awareness of the concept. Take the participants through the broad framework and communicate that the exercise would help them think through how they could gamify a part or whole of their solution.
