1,"STRATEGY, INNOVATION & IMPACT",VISION BUILDING,Startup Canvas,"The canvas summarises the most important elements of an organisation's business model, and is especially useful for early stage startups to think through the different elements. The version of the canvas being used here is inspired by the Lean methodology version of the business model canvas.",The canvas tool is not a problem solving tool as such. It has limited capacity to answer what the ‘right’ model for a business is. It is best used as an evolving summary or dashboard.,90-120 Min,"Investigate and map how ideas or solutions could be transformed into a holistic business model. 
Map current business models, identify gaps and opportunities (priorities), and outline interdependencies. 
Use the canvas as a dashboard to document each stage of evolution of the business model, and reflect on investments and results.","Familiarise yourself: Read through the various boxes in the Startup Canvas, you'll notice the left two columns have to do with internal activity and the two to the right refer to external forces.
Get started: As a business, what do you have most clarity on? Is it your understanding of your customer segment or of the needs your are addressing through your business? Use these questions to decide which side of the canvas to start on.
Complete: Go through each box and fill out as much as you can. It is completely fine not to know the answer to specific areas.
Identify Knowledge Gaps: Once the worksheet is completed to the best your knowledge, jot down in a different colour remaining knowledge gaps. Ask if you have relevant metrics to track your progress for each section?","The ‘Problem’ section is to be used to highlight the core problems that users face, and that the startup is attempting to solve (through its product or service) - these are not problems that the startup is facing as an organisation. 
Use ‘Customer Segments’ to identify the specific profile of users by whom the problem is most acutely felt. Profiles can be very specific, and may be quantised in terms of segments/market size (if data is available). 
‘Solution’ is how the startup plans to address the problem - it could be a product, service, system or a combination of them. 
‘Unfair Advantage’ is the distinct, hard to copy competitive advantage the startup enjoys. 
‘Unique Value Proposition’ is the core compelling message for the user that communicates the value the startup is creating for them. 
‘Channels’ are the ways in which the user will interact with the solution - they way users will become aware of the solution, experience it for the first time, purchase, and then use. 
‘Key Metrics’ are measures of the business's success in reaching and serving the user - could include things like impressions, queries, sign ups, transactions, value of transactions, renewals etc. 
‘Cost Structure’ is the way costs are distributed between fixed and variable costs, and capital investments. 
‘Revenue Streams’ are the ways in which revenue is generated - examples could be one time payments, subscription charges, loyalty fees, tiered pricing etc.","At the start: Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).
During the exercise: Start with participants’ existing knowledge of their business to create a first version of the model. Encourage participants to highlight any component they don't know the answer to for discussion later. 
When summarising: Have participants walk you through their completed canvases, and probe them on the core strengths and weaknesses they would like to build upon. ","Which part of the business do you have the best view on? What are you least informed on?
Is there anything in here you'd like to understand better? Eg. customer segment, value proposition, etc. 
Do you expect your fundamental model and this canvas to change in the next 6 months?
Can you think of any other things you'd like to add to this canvas? Are there any links between boxes you'd like to call out?
What are your company's goals in the next 3-6-12 months? Are you considering them as you map your priorities?
How do you know something is a priority? Is there agreement within your team that these are the top priorities? Is there some assumption involved?
Do your priorities depend on each other? Are there 1-2 core priorities at the root of all the different challenges you might be facing?",,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pvIN9STpzCQ,Lean Canvas | Railsware
2,"STRATEGY, INNOVATION & IMPACT",VISION BUILDING,Ten Types of Innovation,"The Ten Types of Innovation framework is a tool developed by consulting firm Doblin. It maps the fundamental types of innovations that are relevant to organisations, and helps them look at innovation as a holistic activity that involves internal as well as customer facing investments. Under each type of innovation, Doblin has suggested a few strategies and tactics to use as a starting point.","While the Ten Types of Innovation tool is fairly comprehensive, it may be possible that an organisation is looking to offer innovations that are a combination of the different types - causing some initial confusion. Also, the tactics listed may not cover some new trends that teams may need to scan and map. ",90-120 Min,"Map the types of innovation that are currently being offered by an organisation. 
Identify strengths and weaknesses with regards to innovation at an organisation. 
Identify new types of innovation that an organisation can consider. ","Familiarise yourself: Read through the various boxes of the Ten Types of Innovation. Note down what you think is the biggest differentiator in terms of innovation for your business. 
Identify Key Innovations: At the level of Configuration, Offering, and Experience - begin by noting down what makes the business innovative currently. If you have thoughts on what could potentially be future innovations note them down as well. 
Review the Tactics: Read through the tactics under each type of innovation using the ‘Tactics Cheat Sheet‘
Unpack the Innovation: Next, for each type of innovation, note down what makes your business innovative currently. Follow that by noting down potential innovations to explore in the future.
Review & Brainstorm: Review the mapping of current and potential innovations. Make any changes necessary to refine other boxes at the top of the sheet then brainstorm how potential innovations could be created.","There are three major categories of innovation under which the Ten Types fit. 
‘Configuration’: Innovation that focuses on how an organisation is structured. The types of innovation that fall under this category include - 1) Profit Model: How money is made - how revenue, costs and profits are organised. 2) Network: Who an organization innovates with - how suppliers, partners, and external innovators help. 3) Structure: How an organization aligns its talent and assets to create more value - how departments, units, business lines etc. are organised. 4) Process: How superior internal processes and methods help innovation - how quality management, production, supply, procurement, hiring etc. are designed.
‘Offering’: Innovation that focuses on the performance and quality of products and services that are offered to customers. The types that are in this category are - 1) Product Performance: How products and services can deliver superior value to buyers - unique product features and functionality, style, speed, safety, ease, fun etc. 2) Product System: How complementary products and services together create more value - accessories, platforms, value added services, partner discounts etc. 
‘Experience’: Innovation that focuses on how products or services are experienced by users. The types under this category are - 1) Service: How support is provided for users to find, buy, pay, enjoy and dispose - trials, personalisation, delivery and returns, financing, self-service, warranties, repairs etc. 2) Channel: How products and services reach users - pop-up stores, e-commerce, partner stores, events, experience stores etc. 3) Brand: How offerings and organizations are communicated in a memorable, and likeable way - co-branding, own-label, certification, marketing campaigns, packaging, identity etc. 4) Customer Engagement: How user interactions with product or service are delivered - personalised, listening to customers, collaboration, community connect etc.","At the start: Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).
During the exercise: Start with a discussion focused on what kinds of innovation are possible. Take teams through the Ten Types tool, and ask them to fill the worksheet - mapping currently adopted innovation, gaps and opportunities. 
When summarising: Have participants walk you through the worksheet they have filled out and probe them on their mapping of both current and potential innovations.","What do you associate with the word ‘innovation’? How does your organisation look at innovation?
Is your organisation currently innovating in terms of internal processes, product or service performance, or experience - or a combination of these? What is your most important innovation?
What is the biggest gap in terms of innovation for your organisation? How do you compare to your closest competitors?
In terms of configuration - have you looked at internal processes and structures before or have you focused only on external facing innovations?
In terms of Offering and Experience - what do you know about what your customers need? Are your innovations tuned to customer needs?
Have you gone through the tactics? Can you identify those you have been practicing? Is there anything missing that you want to make a note of? 
Which tactics have you considered earlier and chosen not to go forward with? Which tactics are new to you? What do you potentially want to try out?
Does your organization need incremental or transformational innovation?",,,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKvhhqGJ80U,Ten Types of Innovation | Deloitte US
3,"STRATEGY, INNOVATION & IMPACT",VISION BUILDING,Product Roadmap,Roadmapping is an important step of clarifying the direction of a startup or programme over the next few years. It helps the team align on which challenges to prioritise and the ideal path moving forward.,Created for and by the Startup community this format may feel a little tedious - given that pivots and iterations are a reality. Participants should feel free to adapt the template in a way that best reflects their approach and needs.,60-90 Min,"Build consensus on a company's or programme's strategic direction. 
Identify key milestones and responsibilities of each team. 
Formulate an actionable plan for the team to work towards.","Familiarise yourself with the phases: Review the various phases of development and make sure they make sense to everyone (POC, MVP, Alpha, Beta).
Identify teams: In the left-most column identify the teams and skill necessary at each level of development, some phases may require more marketing where other phases require developers.
Map deliverables: Go through each phase and prioritise features and other deliverables linked to each team. The result of the exercise should be discussed and challenged to ensure it is feasible and strategically sound.
Digitise and share: After completion, digitise the document and share it with your teams.","The ‘Team’ column aims to identify teams involved in different phase, and clearly identifying key roles and responsibilities. Teams can include marketing, developers, strategy or any other arm of the practice involved in development. 
‘POC’ or Proof Of Concept is the first tangible version of the concept. It should validate assumptions regarding the functionality and desirability of the product without necessarily having resolved all the technical issues with it.
‘MVP’ short for Minimum Viable Product, refers to the earliest streamlined version of a service or product (only contains key, necessary features) used to understand where the core of the business opportunity lies and if customers respond favourably. 
‘Alpha’ is the first release with a set of actual users in a controlled, experimental environment. This allows for feedback from real users without having to resolve all the bugs and technical challenges.
‘Beta’ is the first public release used to gather feedback from a wide array of users.
‘Launch’ milestones should cover any final challenges regarding going to market like landing strategic partnerships or additional features to be integrated based on feedback on previous iterations.
‘Success Metrics’ should be defined based on the goals and milestones set for each phase of development. These metrics are used to validate assumptions and to guide progress.","At the start: Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).
During the exercise: Help participants understand where they stand on the roadmap and if any edits should be made to the template. 
When summarising: Make sure clear milestones have been formulated, and encourage participants to get input from representatives of the teams listed in the roadmap that may not have been available for the activity. ","Are you familiar with this format? Do you have your own version in your organisation?
What kind of visibility do you have into what the next 3-6-12 months look like?
How far are you currently on this roadmap? Should anything here be changed to reflect your own approach?
Who is part of the core team in your organisation? Let's list them in the left column.
What kind of milestones have you been using so far? Were those clearly communicated to the respective teams? How well did they work?

Discuss how you could potentially address Weaknesses and Threats, and make better use of Opportunities and Strengths.","Use the ‘Strengths’ section to highlight what the product or business does best - could be features, pricing, process, team, partnerships etc. 
‘Weaknesses’ should cover internal shortcomings of the team or product. 
‘Opportunities’ should be used to make a note of external trends and forces that provide a positive chance for the organisation to benefit. 
‘Threats’ are the external factors that pose a risk and could create potential loss for the organisation. ","At the start: Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).

5,"STRATEGY, INNOVATION & IMPACT",VISION BUILDING,Theory of Change,Theory of Change (TOC) is a framework to map 'desired change' against input activities and investments. It helps innovators build relevant strategies for change by differentiating between results and impact. The framework also helps link long term and short-term goals - creating a logical flow that can be used to guide efforts.,"While the TOC helps identify potential strategy, there is little guarantee that activities and resources identified once will guarantee impact on ground. TOCs are often revisited and refined as data from the ground starts emerging.",90-120 Min,"Create an end to end summary of the intended impact strategy of a programme or business at conceptualisation. 
Diagnose and reflect on actual impact, and finetune strategy. 
Identify human and resource investments needed to create impact. ","Define a vision: Discuss the intended impact of the program or service with your team.
Unpack the necessary resources: First fill in the left side of the tool to list the basic financial, staff and network resources needed (or available) to roll out the programme. List down activities that these resources would help carry out. 
Link the efforts to the impact: Link resources and activities to outputs (short-term) and outcomes (long-term) that will lead to the intended impact.
Identify blind spots: Before ending the session, review the template and look for assumptions you might be making at each step and overall for the program. ","The ‘Resources & Inputs’ section is to meant to park the human, knowledge, skill, financial, technological, infrastructural, systemic capabilities that are required to create impact. 
‘Activities’ are those tasks that the resources will help undertake. The nature of these tasks could be both user facing (awareness building, onboarding, servicing etc.) and internal (process development, skill building, hiring, technology adoption etc.). Investors need to be convinced that resources are being spent on priority activities. 
‘Outputs’ are the most basic numbers and metrics that help measure results achieved because of investments made. Without going into whether the efforts were successful or not, the outputs help understand the extent of effort (for example - number of people reached, campaigns undertaken, number of learning sessions held etc.) 
‘Outcomes’ are deeper metrics than outputs and start focusing on both the quantity and quality of results. The stress is importantly on short-medium term impact metrics (for example - level of awareness in people because of campaign, skills built in people because of x number of learning sessions etc.) 
‘Impact’ focuses on longer term shifts - on real, lasting impact created by interventions. The translation of outcomes and outputs into change is really brought to the fore here (for example - does awareness lead to better decision making and choice?, do skills lead to an enhanced ability to be financially empowered? etc.)
‘Assumptions’ are risk factors that an innovator needs to keep in mind as the TOC is being built. Assumptions are important to study and adjust as implementation is done.","At the start: Make sure participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck). 
During the exercise: Start with participants’ existing knowledge of the activity to create a first version of the map. Discuss with them about how they measure the impact of their own investments. 
When summarising: Have participants walk you through the map, and at each step question them on their approach to their plans and assumptions. ","What is the long-term impact that you want to create? 
What are some key resources and capabilities that you have access to?
What sort of activities are your current resources and capabilities utilised for? 
What kind of quantitative results or outputs (short and long term) do your resources and activities help you create? Do these outputs help you achieve desired long-term change? 
What are the desired output levels? What kind of additional resources do you need to get to these levels? How do you plan to access these resources?

The aim is to repeatedly unpack each symptom or sign until one reaches a “root cause” or angle worth considering. While traditionally the tool is looked only through a problem lens, it can also use it to look at opportunities, and even trends. 5 Whys is a tool that is often run as part of the Problem Tree activity - it helps get to root causes.",Teams may struggle to map effects and causes early in the design process - both in terms of range and quality - these gaps in the mapping process should ideally inform themes to be covered by research. ,60 Min,"Unpack a problem or topic to further understanding in a group.

List the effects: Start by listing visible effects of the problem at hand and then try to identify more indirect impacts of the problem.
List the causes: List potential causes for the given problem or opportunity. List all potential causes the team can think of - keep creating branches.
Dig deeper: To really get into the depth (or root cause) - use the '5 Whys' - until you feel that you have a strong enough root cause.","The ‘Problem/Opportunity’ should be something specific that needs to be investigated. This could be the problem faced by the user, or an opportunity area defined by a team or organisation.
‘Effects’ are the visible or invisible results of the problem. These should be mapped on the branches of the tree - for example, if the problem is defined as ‘Poor Public Transport’, then an effect would probably be, ‘Commuter getting late to work’, or ‘Expensive private transport options’.
‘Causes’ are underlying reasons behind the problem or opportunity. They are mapped on the roots of the tree - for example, the root cause of ‘Poor Public Transport’ could probably be, ‘Inadequate public funding’ or ‘Poor route planning’.
The levels to which ‘Effects’ and ‘Causes’ can be unpacked depend on the understanding the team has of the topic at hand. ","At the start: Explain the activity to the participants, preferably using examples. Make sure they first write down the effects and then the causes.
During the exercise: Ensure that the participants don‘t get stuck or fixate on a single train of thought.

Experts usually have limited time available, and may on occasions need to be monetarily rewarded for sharing their experiences and expertise. ","Experts often have a strong view on things. It is important to not get totally overawed.

Note important findings on a sheet. Next, take a look at the lines of enquiry and key questions from the plan. Prepare a final list of questions for the expert.
Introduce yourself: Start the interview by introducing yourself and building credibility.
Conduct the interview: Go through the questions you have for the expert and take notes (record audio if you have recieved consent).
Conclude the interview: At the end of your interview ask the expert if there is anything else they'd like to add or cover on the topic.","The key part of an expert interview is the preparation. The participants should familiarise themselves with the experts’ work prior to interviews and prepare a few ‘Notes on their work or activity’ to refer back to during the interview.
The ‘Interview Questions’ should be clear and prioritised so the most important questions can come up earlier in the interview in case the interview is cut short. An expert's point of view should be valued and the person should be made to feel important - researchers should not rush through such conversations (unless experts wish to do so). 
In the interviews, go deep into expert input that seems new and insightful - clarify with the intent of learning, and ask follow up questions where required. 
Encourage experts to speak of things they are passionate about, but also ensure that the areas you intend to cover are not missed out. ","At the start: Help participants clearly identify the themes or lines of inquiry they‘d like to research.
During the exercise: Check on the profile of experts that teams intend to reach out to. Help teams formulate questions that can get them the information they need from the experts identified.

17,HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN,DISCOVERY,User Interviews,"Collecting first-hand accounts of experiences, needs and concerns from people can be a great source of inspiration. User interviews are one of the most powerful tools available to researchers. Interviews unlike surveys are meant to be deep, open ended conversations. They can be done in context (at users' homes and places of work) or at a neutral location (like a cafe). In context interviews allow researchers to observe users go about their tasks - which can be an additional source of insight. ","User interviews take time and effort to organise, conduct and synthesise. While user interviews provide rich and grounded perspectives, it is not feasible to do large sample interview based studies. The quality of information is more important than the quantity of information while using research methods such as interviews - researchers should be prepared to defend their work in case the quantity question comes up.

Break the ice: This part of an interview is about making respondents feel comfortable. Ask a couple of easy/light questions that get respondents into the groove.
Ask open-ended questions: The main part of the interview is focused on getting into the shoes of the respondents. Dependent on the topic of research - ask respondents to share stories and specific experiences. Build a conversation. 
Follow-up questions: Use follow-up questions to dig deeper into specific aspects of things the respondent may be sharing. Get into behaviours in detail, discuss motivations and needs. ","For a smooth interview, an interviewer should prepare a simple Discussion Guide - a repository of questions to be asked in the interview. This will help keep track of the discussion and ensure all the intended topics are covered. Guides should be prepared by looking closely at lines of enquiry and key questions. Experienced researchers may only need brief guides with top level questions. To be safe, a repository of both key questions and follow up queries should be prepared. 
The ‘Personal Introduction’ helps set the tone of the interview and establish mutual respect. If the session is to be recorded this is a good time to request consent from the respondent.
The ‘Icebreaker’ can simply be a set of questions or an activity that is easy for the participant to complete to get them more comfortable with the interview. These can be simple questions like their age, professional activity, their hobbies or what a typical day looks like for them.
The ‘Open-Ended Questions’ should be formulated to help participants open up and share as much as possible about the experience being discussed.
The ‘Follow-Up Questions’ help the interviewer better understand the why and the how of a story: Why has a person done what they did? How do they feel about it? Was it confusing? Challenging? Empowering? Such questions will result in the identification of potential pain points to be addressed by the product or service being designed.","At the start: Help participants clearly identify the themes or lines of enquiry they‘d like to research.

Keep doing that until your documentation is comprehensive. 
Ask why: Once you've completed the template, ask yourself why things are the way they are. These will remain assumptions but will help broaden your thinking regarding the topic at hand.","The ‘Objects’ section of the tool is where observations pertaining to physical objects or touchpoints that are part of the experience are to be recorded. Researchers should list all the objects as comprehensively as possible - those directly involved in the user experience, and those in the background. 
The ‘Environment’ section of the map is where notes regarding the physical space and setting should be written down - the type of space, the layout, sitting arrangements, the mood or tone of the space, maintenance, lighting etc. can be the kind of things that researchers could record. 
The ‘People’ section refers to the people involved - for example, these could be users, service providers, other service providers, partners, and other stakeholders (like govt staff or police). Researchers should describe what the roles and behaviours of the people observed.
The ‘Services’ section looks at the systems and processes that form part of the experience. Although the observer may be intending to study one service (for example using public transit), that very service might involve many more smaller services (payment methods, luggage handling, ticket purchase, check in-check out etc).
The ‘Messaging’ section looks at communication targeted at the user in the observed space. Messaging could be physical - branding signage, advertising, sales material, or it could be delivered through conversations between users and service staff.","At the start: Explain the activity to the participants, explaining that they should write down any observations that they spot.

20,HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN,DISCOVERY,Card Sorting,"Card Sorting is a research activity in which respondents are given cards that carry certain visual cues, and are then asked to arrange these cards in an order relevant to the research enquiry. Cards sorting replaces survey type questions that ask respondents to prioritise, group or react to certain product, service, or system aspects. The visual nature of cards helps minimise loss in translation, and increases engagement during research. Discussing the card sorting while it is taking place helps understand respondent attitudes and needs. ","Visuals on cards can impact understanding - contextualization and localization are a must.

Lay the cards out: Before starting the activity with a respondent, lay the cards out before them, and explain the specific objective of the exercise.
Discuss and organise: As respondents do the card sort, discuss their thought process.","The most critical thing while deciding on a card sort is to define purpose clearly. Purpose should ideally be derived from the lines of enquiry identified in the research plan. A card sort can be done to - 1) Map preference - for example, what kind of onboarding approaches do users like?, 2) Map sequence - what should be the steps in an ideal hotel check in?, 3) Map association - which brands are premium and which are value for money? 
Visual cards are used in contexts where respondents can't fully describe their choices using words - for example, can users pick between different digital onboarding journeys without visual support? 
The choice of visuals on the cards, and the number of cards is dependent on the purpose of the research.
Visuals on cards can be images, sketches, screenshots etc. These visuals represent things that are to be Prioritised, sequenced or categorised. ","At the start: Make sure the participants understand the flow of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).

Present to users: Present the scenarios to respondents, and see what they understand at first. Then explain to them the concept, and have them give feedback on each scenario.
Collect feedback: Once the scenarios have been presented, have the respondents share their feedback by asking them what they think of the concept.
","A scenario is either an end-to-end representation of a service journey, or a focused view of one part of the journey. Scenarios can be used to receive feedback from respondents on a current journey, evaluate different versions of a current journey, or imagine new journeys.
Scenarios that capture critical milestones and touch-points can often be sufficient. Over detailing can get the respondent caught up in details.
Text and visuals are both used to build scenarios - so that there is minimal loss in translation. Headline text to describe the overall scenario, and descriptive text explaining a milestone can be used. 
Visuals on a scenario should be as contextualised and localised as much as possible. Icons and sketches that are alien can confuse respondents.
In any session 3-4 scenarios may be enough to place before a respondent.
Scenarios are often used as a part of User Interviews - they are what researchers call 'probes'. They help researchers touch upon aspects of experience and need that an oral conversation may not be able to cover. 
Respondents should be asked to comment on each scenario, and then summarise their feedback once at the end. As respondents study scenarios, researchers should be prepared to answer any questions that come up.
","At the start: See if the team is clear on which scenarios they wish to place before respondents and why. If they aren't - help them brainstorm.

25,HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN,DEFINE,Affinity Mapping,"Affinity Mapping is a synthesis tool aimed at identifying insights from qualitative research observations and findings. It involves organizing key data points into clusters (called Affinities) that are logical, thematic, and consistent, and then discussing the clusters to the point that clear learnings and insights emerge.","While Affinity Mapping is a great way to look for patterns and insights, it can be an exhausting exercise - what observations and data points to consider?, are the clusters distinct enough?, how macro or micro should the clusters be?, what is the relationship between clusters etc. are all questions that can lead to confusion and inconclusive debate. It is important for the team to look at the exercise as something that requires iteration.",60 Min,"Structure the team's thinking on the topic being researched.
Organise research findings into buckets of information and themes that make sense
Translate themes of information into learnings ","Review the research: Ask team members to review the data collected during the research, and use sticky notes to document interesting points - critical observations, quotes from users, data and facts, and even early learnings. One data point per sticky note. 
Place, discuss, group: Each person should then describe each of their notes to the others and start adding them to the wall. As related points come up, the team should start forming clusters - group the notes based on similar or complementary data points.
Unpack clusters: If at any point there seem to be multiple number of themes emerging under one cluster - the cluster should be broken down into smaller clusters. 
Review wall: Review the clusters with the group, make sure everyone relates with the themes, and check if anything is missing.
Discuss Learnings: Discuss what each of the themes mean in terms of learnings and insights. ","Information for this exercise should be sourced from either secondary or primary research activities the team has conducted. 
The ‘Observation’, ‘Quote’, ’Data’, ’Facts’ are the kinds of information that be used by the team. Mentioning the source of the data (for example - the particular respondent, a blog, a particular expert, a particular train station etc.) adds credibility to the notes shared. 
Any information should be written down on a sticky note and added to the wall. Each note should be complete - not too short nor wordy. One data point per sticky note. 
Sticky notes when added to the wall have to be parked in groups or clusters based on a common theme. 
‘Themes’ start emerging as grouping of similar or complementary information starts taking place. There is no one set rule for identifying a theme - it is a matter of making sure each theme is complete in itself - it makes conceptual, logical, and emotional sense.
If there are close connections or interdependencies between themes - describing that relationship is important at this stage. 
Moving forward from the themes, a team is meant to discuss and draw learnings and insights through a process of iterative synthesis - asking where the themes emerge from? What do the themes mean? And why are they important? ","At the start: Have everyone spend time silently going over their research notes and write down valuable information on sticky notes. 
During the exercise: Help the participants form clusters, feel free to make suggestions for new clusters or ask if some can be broken down further.
When summarising: Have participants present to other groups. Discuss how each team has structured their maps, and what teams could learn from each other.","Have the teams made a note of their key data points on sticky notes? Have you provided sources for at least the key ones? 
Who will start in each team? How will you keep a check on what themes are emerging?
What clusters are starting to emerge? Can the team walk me through them?
Should any cluster be broken down further?
Has anything come up that felt new, surprising, refreshing? If so make a note of it - consider using sticky notes of a different color. 
Are there things that can sit under two or more themes? Are they represented in both clusters?

26,HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN,DEFINE,ERAF Diagram,"ERAF Diagrams are often referred to as system maps. They are used to represent complex ecosystems that involve multiple Entities (people, organisations, systems). The ERAF diagram documents the Attributes (descriptions, roles, needs) of the chosen Entities, helps call out Relationships (connections) between them, and describes the Flows (the nature of relationships) between the Entities. Together, the diagram focuses on some of the most aspects required to understand and design for a system.

Define attributes: Describe key attributes of each of the entities - use one or more sticky notes to do this. 
Describe relationships: Start connecting entities that are related. Provide space on the board in a way that the connecting lines do not get messy. Describe the relationships on sticky notes - key strengths, weaknesses etc. 
Describe flows: Describe the specific nature of exchange between entities - human, material, informational, financial, influence etc. ","‘Entities’ are definable parts of the system. For example, physical entities could be people, places, and things, or conceptual such as projects, problems, or goals.
‘Relationships’ describe how the entities connect with one another. They describe the nature of the connection.
The ‘Attributes’ are characteristics of any entity or relation. Qualitative Attributes could be names, brands, perceptions, whereas Quantitative Attributes could be age, size, cost, duration or any other measurable element.
‘Flows’ help understand the true nature of relationships between entities. Flows could be of people, material, finance, information etc. - moving from one entity to another.","At the start: Explain the activity to participants - take them through the different parts of the tool. If this is a sense making exercise - ask them to document what they know. If ERAF is being used to imagine a new system - engage them accordingly.
During the exercise: Help participants define various parts of the map. Help them visualise the maps in a clear and organised manner. 
When summarising: Have participants share their maps, and have them point out any interesting insights they may have come up with.","Why do you want to use the ERAF map? Will it help you understand an existing system? or, Imagine a new system?

28,HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN,DEFINE,Persona,"Personas are one of the most important tools within the world of user-centered design. They are fictional “characters” that represent a type of user or stakeholder for whom a solution has to be developed. A Persona is not a single demographic segment of users, but instead a representation of a certain type of needs, behaviours, and motivations - that may be reflected by multiple people across demographic segments. Instead of designing for anonymous user segments - Personas help focus on real people and needs.

Quality and range of research respondents directly impact the kind of Personas a team is able to define - whether they are relevant, logical, specific, recognisable, and targettable.",30+ Min,"Document critical needs, behaviours and motivations of target users and stakeholders.
Humanise target users and stakeholders as representative profiles.","Find patterns: Based on research data, identify patterns emerging with regards to types of users. Types could be based on factors such as - the most common, most challenging, most accessible, most experimental etc.
Define Persona: For a chosen type of user, provide the information required. For specific behaviours, motivators, and pain points - base these on actual data collected during research.
Illustrate Persona: Visualise the type as a single individual that becomes the face and voice of that user type. Visualisation is important to humanise the user. It is completely fine for visuals to not be perfect. 
Build More Personas: Personas can be created for as many user types as the team feels necessary to consider for design. ","The ‘Name’ and ‘Relevant Demographics’ section is to be filled with basic details of the target user, such as Age, Gender, Income, Family Size, Occupation.
‘About’ helps add context to the Persona - humanizing the profile as a believable, relatable individual.
‘Broad Goals’ are the key aspirations and motivations that describe the Persona's view on life overall, or on a specific aspect of life that is relevant to design (for example - goals relevant to financials planning and investment in life).
‘Specific Needs/Problems’ are the needs of the Persona - specific to the problem or opportunity being designed for.
‘Specific Behaviours’ are current actions that best describe the way the Persona engages with the problem or opportunity.
‘Specific Motivators’ are the key attitudes that drive the way the Persona engages with the problem or opportunity.
‘Specific Pain Points’ are the key issues and challenges that the Persona wants to avoid engaging with the problem or opportunity.
‘Quotes’ are specific statements made by respondents during User Interviews or Focus Group Discussions - they best capture the essence of the Persona. ","At the start: Make sure participants understand the exercise and guide them through the activity with examples.
During the exercise: Discuss the user types chosen by teams to convert into Personas. Help them choose relevant and powerful data points for each section of the tool.

Attributes, Scale & Entities: Make a list of attributes that are most important to map. Decide what scale extremes are relevant for each of the attributes. Next, decide on the actual entities that need to be mapped on the scale. Entities can be users, products or services, organizations or any other relevant entities that need to be compared. 
Map Scores: Go attribute by attribute, and map each entity on the scales. Draw lines to connect scores on each attribute (for each entity). 
Review Patterns & Discuss: Review patterns emerging, and discuss learnings and insights.","‘Attributes’ are the qualities/features/offerings - for example - pricing, personalisation, digitisation, frequency of mailers etc. - that designers may want to compare entities on. There can be multiple attributes as required.
‘Scales’ serve as a measure of attributes. They are used to score entities, and are typically defined by two extremes points (low - high) or in terms of opposites (physical - digital).
‘Entities’ are those things that need to be compared. These could be users (for example - young, middle age, old customers), competitors (for example - startups, small companies, established companies), products and services (for example - different car models, apps, banking experiences), geographies (for example - rural, urban, peri urban) etc. Comparison between the entities helps designers arrive at patterns and insights.
‘Scores’ are points on the attribute scales that best describe an entity. 
Score lines connect scores of one entity across the different attributes - creating a visual path that can be used for comparison between entities. 
Patterns are the visual trends that emerge once the mapping of score lines is complete. ","At the start: Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).
During the exercise: Start with a discussion on what attributes need to be mapped, and which entities need to be compared. Ask the teams to also define the scales for each attribute. Guide them while they map, and question how they arrive at scores.

‘It reflects the insights and learnings’ is the criteria that focuses on how well rooted an idea is in the insights and learnings that have emerged from research.
‘Users will find it desirable’ is the criteria that focuses on whether the idea is something that will be welcomed by users - because it obviously enhances positive experience or addresses negatives.
‘The team is excited about it’ is the criteria that focuses on whether the idea is something the team is passionate about building.
‘Other Criteria’ are those criteria that the team can specify themselves - costs involved, skills available, technology available, ideas successfully implemented by competition etc. could be some criteria to look into. 
Scores under each of the criteria could be given individually (and then averaged or summed) or by the team as a whole. Allocating weightages (for example - 50% to desirability, 20% to excitement, 20% to solves problem) to criteria is a decision left to the team.

38,HUMAN CENTERED DESIGN,IDEATION,Service Blueprint,"A Service Blueprint is an expanded version of the Journey Map. While a Journey Map captures the essence of the user journey, focuses on key user actions, and helps map moments of positive and negative experience - the Service Blueprint brings in the added dimension of the service provider journey that runs parallel to the one the user is experiencing. From the Blueprint's point of view - the user side of the experience is the front-end, and the service provider side of the experience is the back-end. The tool helps service providers establish the connect between front-end experience, and back-end processes and systems - helping identify opportunities for improvement and investment. ",Connecting front-end and back-end activities and processes on the Service Blueprint can be often confusing and cumbersome.

Map the Service Provider Journey: Once all the steps at the user side have been clearly listed, map the key actions and systems from the service provider point of view. Also, identify any third party/external partner dependencies for the service provider.
Review the Blueprint: Ensure the Blueprint captures front and back end aspects of the experience in as much detail as possible. Discuss how the two may be impacting or could potentially impact each other.","In the top most row of the template, there are three broad phases called out - Awareness Building, Service Delivery, and Retention - these are classic user journey phases - it is okay for the team to continue with these or reframe. A designer may choose to focus on the entire end-to-end journey or just one part of it.
'User Touchpoints' are the key user tasks and interactions that comprise the front-end experience. To build detail, it is recommended that designers call out people interactions, objects, environments, and messaging that together make up this front-end experience. 
'Service Touchpoints' are the key service provider tasks, processes and systems that comprise the back-end. There may be objects, environments, and messaging that are part of both the user and service provider end - for example, a check in form at a hotel is used by users to declare details about themselves, and is also used by service providers to keep a record of their customers. It is important for designers to make connections between the front and back-end at this level of detail.
'External Actors' are third party vendors, partners, and stakeholders who have a strong influence on back-end systems and processes, and sometimes even on front-end experience - for example, a third party cab provider who offers airport pickups and drops for hotel guests.
","At the start: Make sure participants understand the goal of the activity and the key parts of the template. 
During the exercise: Help participants map their user journey first, and then connect back-end processes and systems to the different user experience stages. Check if any external actors are involved.

A storyboard is a combination of illustrations, descriptive text, and dialogue (to represent interaction between users and service providers). 
A storyboard may focus on the entire end-to-end journey, or just a specific user task / part of the service - for example, opening a new user account, submitting KYC documents, depositing loan payments etc. 
Storyboards try and cover not just people interactions but also document objects, environments, and messaging (think POEMS) that make up a complete service experience. 
While there is no set number of scenes required, 3-10 frames are a safe target to aim for - 3 for simple stories focused on a key service aspect, and 10 if one is trying to capture the essence of a complete end-to-end experience.","At the start: Make sure the team has a clear understanding of the key steps of their service.

","Outline the key steps: Start by discussing as a team the key stages, user actions and interactions along the experience journey. Refer to the Journey Map tool if the team has already developed one.
Visualise the touchpoints: For each step in the service journey, identify the screens necessary to bring the concept to life and draw them out one after the other. Design different versions of the wireframes if the intent is to do A/B testing.
Connect the screens: Connection the different screens by linking how a button may lead from one screen to another.
Test & Refine: Test wireframes with different users, and record points of improvement.","Wireframes are basic visualisations - boxes and texts are used to represent eventual digital screens. 
It is rare for designers to build wireframes for each and every step of a service journey - the focus is usually on key screens and interactions. Alternatively, detailed wireframes are often built for one part of the journey - for example, onboarding screens, learning section, profile pages etc.
Typically, phone outlines are used to communicate that the screens are meant for an app. Similarly for web screens - a laptop outline can be used. 
Screens are connected by drawing lines between them. Lines represent how screens are intended to flow from one to another. 
Versions of screens can be drawn to represent a service journey in different ways - this is useful for more thorough user testing. 
Wireframes are tested with users in the form of paper prints or as interactive prototypes (where buttons actually work). An interactive digital prototype can be created by using basic software like PowerPoint, or professional design software like Zeplin or Invision. 
While testing, as users go over screens - aided (where designers explain each screen) or unaided (no explanations given) - designers need to keep a note of feedback - positive and negative. ","At the start: Make sure the team has a clear understanding of the key steps of their service.

‘Testing Formats’ is the section in which the format of the experiment has to be described, for example - visual concept test, interactive screen test, test with app users etc. The test may involve studying actual use of a product or service, or may involve recording feedback for concepts (similar level to scenarios and card sort).
‘Testing Scope’ is the section in which the designer has to define how versions are different from each other - along with rationale on why the differences are relevant. This would include specifying constants and variables in each version. 
‘Tester Profile’ is the section in which the designer needs to identify who the different versions are to be tested with. Usually, in A/B testing there is a ‘Control’ group that a base version is tested with, and ‘Treatment’ groups with which different versions are tested. 
‘Test Learnings’ is the section in which one has to note down the results of testing - in terms of metrics or just a collation of the feedback received from testers. 
Note: Tests are considered valid if different groups of a single user type test all versions (for example - existing customer groups 1,2,n testing version A,B,n). Tests are also valid if different versions are tested with one group of one customer type (for example - group 1 of customers test version A,B,n).

‘Direct The Rider’: behaviour change can happen when we provide crystal clear direction to the ‘rational side’ (The Rider) of a person who is to adopt a behaviour. To be able to appeal to the rational side, one can follow three strategies - 1) Follow The Bright Spots - Build on existing positive behaviours and success stories - learn from people with positive behaviours and use that to influence others and design interventions. 2) Script the Critical Moves - Dissolve the resistance by breaking down the change into logical, specific tasks - identify clear actions that can be taken and how they contribute to change. 3) Point to the Destination - Create a specific goal that people can work towards and respond to - identify and point to an end state that is logical and desired. 
‘Motivate The Elephant’: Behaviour change can happen when we engage a person’s emotions (The Elephant). To appeal to people’s ‘emotional’ side, one can follow three strategies - 1) Find the Feeling - Make people feel positively inspired to change - identify what motivations exist and how they can be enhanced. 2) Shrink The Change: Break down seemingly large complex change into simple, small steps until it no longer seems daunting 3) Grow Your People: Identify skills, knowledge, resources, tools, rewards etc. that can help equip people with the skills, knowledge and agency needed for change. 
‘Shape The Path’: Behaviour change can happen when one changes the context (The Path) in which action is happening. To be able to create an enabling ‘environment’, one can follow three strategies - 1) Tweak the Environment: Tweak elements in the physical environment that are bottlenecks, and/or introduce new elements that can enable desired Behaviour 2) Build Habits: Translate behaviour change into habits by identify ways to make desired behaviour repeatable and consistent - provide for more cycles of learning 3) Rally the Herd: Get change recognised and adopted by other people - identify ways to involve groups, and to get them to support and own the change.","At the start: Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).
During the exercise: Start with participants’ understanding of current behaviours being displayed, and discuss the Behaviour change desired. Discuss the three components of behaviour change from the SWITCH Framework - rational (Rider), emotional (Elephant), and environment (Path). 
When summarising: Have participants walk you through the worksheet that they have created, and probe them on what a comprehensive strategy looks like. ","What is the behaviour change you are focusing on? Why is that your focus?
Are you looking to create behaviour change through your product or service? Or, are you looking to change behaviour in the way people interact with your product or service?
Why do you think it is important to appeal to people’s rational side? How do you want to do it? Are there any bright spots or current positive behaviours you can learn from? 
What specific behaviours do you want people to adopt? Have you broken change down into logical steps with clear impact?
What is the end goal or state you want people to work towards?
How are you appealing to people's’ emotions? 
How are you making it easy - what is the first step you want people to take?
How are you encouraging people to change? How are you preparing them and equipping them?
What do you want to change about the environment? Will you need new resources or using will you use currently available resources in a new way?
How can desired behaviour be made repeatable? Does your success depend on desired behaviour become a habit?
How will you involve other people in the change process? How will you target and grow early adopters?",,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X9KP8uiGZTs,SWITCH Framework | Rare
49,BEHAVIOURS & DESIGN,TOOLS,Hook Model,"The Hook Model is a tool used to design for frequent and engaged use of products, services and systems by users. The model focuses on identifying ways to make the user experience simpler, more engaging, and more rewarding so that users keep returning to use a product or service. For a business, habit based products or services are more efficient, offer business predictability, and generate greater customer lifetime value. The model is relevant as a strategy for both first time users (get them to sign up, and come back), and for those who may have used a product or service before (get them to keep using).",The Hook Model was developed based on learnings of user behaviour on online platforms and social networking sites. It may therefore come across as a limited framework in some contexts. ,90-120 Min,"Identify a strategy to encourage users to come back to a product or service after they have used it for the first time.
Identify a strategy to encourage users to keep using a product or service over time. 
Identify a strategy to encourage habits and repeated behaviour in any context. ","Familiarise yourself: Read through the various boxes of the Hook Model and consider how these may apply to a current or proposed product/service.
First Time/New User: Begin by considering how a first time or new user is being taken through the steps. Start by mapping the current journey, and then identify gaps.
Existing Users: Next, consider an existing user who can potentially stay with the product or service for a long time. Map the current journey, and then identify gaps. 
Brainstorm & Discuss: Based on the gaps identified for new and current users, next identify potential solutions to experiment with.","There are four major components of the HOOK Model - ‘Triggers’, ‘Action’, ‘Rewards’ and ‘Investment’.
‘Triggers’: Things that prompt users to interact with a product/service. There are two types - 1) Internal Triggers are associated with basic emotions (such as boredom, loneliness, excitement), and routines (such as reading, budgeting, seeking a deal) that users are trying to address. If a product or service is closely associated with an emotion or routine - that association functions as the trigger. 2) External Triggers: Triggers that are focused on marketing and communication influencing customers. There are four types of external triggers - A) Paid Triggers: Advertising, search engine marketing, and other paid channels. B) Earned Triggers: Things like press mentions, awards, viral online stories etc. that are not paid for. C) Relationship Triggers: Recommendations from customers, communities, and partners. D) Owned Triggers: Triggers that use company's own channels once a user has signed up or made a purchase - app icons, notifications, newsletters etc.
‘Action’: Things that minimise users’ efforts and increase ease of use of a product or service -  make users come back. There are six elements to minimising effort - 1) Time: Reduce the time it takes to start using a product or service. 2) Money: Reduce the monetary cost for users. 3) Physical effort: Reduce the amount of labor involved in use. 4) Brain cycles: Reduce the level of mental effort and focus required to use. 5) Social deviance: Reduce the resistance the use faces from the user’s communities. 6) Non-routine: Reduce the level to which the use disrupts existing routines. 
‘Variable Rewards’: Things that incentivise and engage users to use a product or service. Variable rewards are incentives that vary with time, challenge, loyalty etc. as a way to keep users engaged. There are three fundamental types of rewards - 1) Reward of the Tribe: Rewards that focus on social participation, and recognition. 2) Reward of the Hunt: Rewards that focus on material, and informational benefit. 3) Reward of the Self: Rewards that focus on self development, and personal growth. 
‘Investment’: Things that get users to invest time, resources and effort, and therefore associate value in a product and service. There are five main ways in which users can become invested - 1) Content: Users stay if they create and store content that they value. 2) Data: Users stay if they share and link information (like KYC) that they rather not share again if not essential. 3) Network: Users stay if they become a part of a community - as a follower, a friend, as someone with followers - once they have personal and community bonds. 4) Reputation: Users stay when they have a positive reputation within a community. 5) Skill: Users stay if they develop skill or knowledge that they value.","At the start: Make sure participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).
During the exercise: Start with a discussion focused on why habit forming products and services are important. Walk teams through the tool, and move along the four stage cycle. Ask teams to map what they do currently, identify gaps and think of ideas for strengthening each phase of the cycle. 
When summarising: Have participants walk you through the worksheet they have filled out and probe them on their mapping of the current, and ideas for things they can try out.","Why is creating a habit around your product or service important? 
What is the fundamental need you are solving for? Is that important enough to be an internal trigger?
How are you thinking of creating stickiness for a new/first time user? How are you thinking of creating stickiness for an existing user?
What kind of triggers have you considered currently? What have you not considered? How have you used external triggers? How can you improve them? 
How easy is it for first time and existing users to use your product or service? What can be eased based on your understanding of what their needs are? Are there examples that you can learn from?
How are users being rewarded? Is the reward evident? Is there variability and unpredictability? Are you considering the three types of rewards? Any examples you can borrow from? 
How are you ensuring that users stay invested in your product/service? What kind of investments do you want them to make? Will asking users to invest impact ease and trust negatively? 
Are you encouraging useful, positive habits for your users, or are you thinking only from the business perspective? ",,1,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-jXM4NymIcA,How to Build Habit-Forming Products | Nir Eyal
50,BEHAVIOURS & DESIGN,TOOLS,Gamification Board,Gamification is a concept that borrows from techniques that game designers use to engage players. It applies the same kind of approaches to non-game experiences - to motivate and engage users. The Gamified Board is a tool that helps designers think through the application of gamification principles as part of their product or service experience.,Gamification is often looked at as a comprehensive answer to all customer engagement needs. It is only one type of approach. It should be used sparingly and thoughtfully. It does not guarantee better customer engagement in itself - especially if the core value proposition and features are weak. ,60-90 Min,"Create a new service or product experience with gamified elements as a way to differentiate experience.
Introduce gamification as a part of current product or service experience as a way to improve engagement 
Note: The Gamification Board is a starting point for actual gamified elements to be designed, and tested as prototypes - it is in a sense a planning and scoping tool. ","Familiarise yourself: Read through the template and discuss the broad goal of gamification.
Game Dynamics: Choose the game dynamics that you want to create. List out why these dynamics are important to create and how they will be created. 
Missions, Levels & Tasks: Break down the game dynamics into missions, levels and tasks that users will have to complete as a way of participating in the gamified experience. 
Points, Badges & Leaderboards: List out when, why and how many points and badges will be awarded to users for participating in missions, levels, and tasks. Outline how leaderboards and dashboards will be used to inform users.
Review & Discuss: Discuss the gamified concept that can be derived from the board.","‘Broad Goal’ is the strategic reason gamification is being chosen as a strategy - increasing engagement, forming habits, differentiating experience etc. could be some goals to consider. 
‘Game Dynamics’ are the broad strategies that designers use to realise gamification. Among these are - 1) Competition: Creating a sense of competition at individual and team level helps increase engagement. 2) Collaboration: Creating a sense of community and collaboration engages users, and motivates them. 3) Progress & Achievement: A journey that signifies growth and evolution for individuals and teams engages people. 4) Exploration and Surprise: A certain unpredictability and sense of adventure engages people.
‘Game Mechanics’ are specific tactics that help designers realise game dynamics. Among these are - 1) ‘Missions’: Create a sense of progress, and help navigate users towards a desired end state - for example, financial planning could be broken down into short term, mid term and long term missions. 2) ‘Levels’: Stages into which Missions are broken down - for example, financial planning may have levels such as - basic, adequate, excellent. 3) ‘Tasks’: Activities within levels that need to be completed to move past Levels and complete Missions - for example, planning in the short term may mean investing in deposits, insurance, equity funds etc. 4) ‘Points’: Keep score of tasks, levels, and missions completed - for example, financial investments of different types fetch different points for users. 5) ‘Badges’: Indicators of accomplishment that go beyond points - for example, for financial planners - someone who invests regularly could get a badge of ‘responsible investor’, someone else who tries new investments could get one that says - 'the adventurer' etc. 6) ‘Leaderboards’: Bring alive the sense of competition by showing where individuals and teams stand vis a vis each other in terms of points, badges, progress level etc.","At the start: Make sure participants understand the goal of the activity and the directions (refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck).
During the exercise: Start with a discussion on gamification and the teams’ awareness of the concept. Take the participants through the broad framework, and engage them in discussion on how gamification may or may not be relevant to them.
When summarising: Have participants walk through the worksheet and probe them on how they will translate their strategy on gamification into prototypes and experiments. ","What do you understand by gamification? Are there aspects of your current solution that you would say are gamified? Have you seen or experienced any gamification? What can you learn from there?

Set up the call: Whether in person or online, make sure the mentor is available and has all the information they need about you. Mentors may want to see the elevator deck, or a detailed business plan before meeting you. On your end, prepare a few key questions you'd like to discuss, and try and send these over to the mentor before the meeting. 
Keep in touch: If a valuable relationship starts, make sure to keep them in the loop about your progress. ","The template provided is only meant to be a representative agenda for a mentor-participant discussion. Reasonable time must be allocated to each part of the conversation.  
It is important that at least in the first conversation, participants introduce themselves and their role at the organization they are representing. A script for this can be noted in the ‘Introduce yourself’ section. 
The ‘Present your product or service’ is the core of mentor-participant conversation. This could be done using a pitch deck or a business plan document - at least for the first time. If this is a repeat or a regular conversation - the discussion can be a much more focused on an aspect that the mentor and participant have interest in engaging on. 
‘Collect feedback’ is the part of the conversation in which participants can share points they'd like feedback on. Based on the theme of the conversation, Mentors are likely to have their own questions and inputs at this stage.
","Prior to the session: Help make the mentor-participant connect. If happening offline at a workshop - this should be easier. However, if the mentors and participants are coordinating online - ensure that each participant has found at least one relevant mentor to speak to. 
During the check-in: If this is part of a workshop, and participants and mentors are networking -  ensure that participants get to speak to relevant mentors, and get enough time with mentors.

As time for conversation lapses, individuals from the mobile group move to the next station to have another conversation. This continues till an intended number of conversations have taken place.
‘Talking Points’ are essentially the key aspects that the conversation should be focused on - this depends on the nature of the session. For participant-mentor discussions, participants are encouraged to practice their elevator pitches for example, and have questions ready based on the backgrounds of the mentors.","Prior to the session: Make sure everyone is aware of the time they will be given and what will be discussed.
