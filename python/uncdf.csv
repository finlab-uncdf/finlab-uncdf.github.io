1,"STRATEGY, INNOVATION & IMPACT",VISION BUILDING,Startup Canvas,"The Startup Canvas summarises the most important elements of an organisation's business model, and is especially useful for early stage startups to think through the different elements. The version of the canvas being used here is inspired by the Lean methodology version of the Business Model Canvas (BMC).
","The Startup Canvas tool is not a problem solving tool as such. It has limited capacity to answer what the ‘right’ model for a business is. It is best used as an evolving summary or dashboard.
",90-120 Min,"Investigate and map how ideas or solutions could be transformed into a holistic business model. 
Map current business models, identify gaps and opportunities (priorities), and outline interdependencies. 
Use the canvas as a dashboard to document each stage of evolution of the business model, and reflect on investments and results.","Familiarise yourself: Read through the various boxes in the Startup Canvas. You'll notice the columns on the left have to do with internal activity, and the ones to the right, refer to external forces.
Get started: As a business, what do you have most clarity on? Is it your understanding of your customer segment or of the needs you are addressing through your business? Start with the side of the canvas you think you know better.
Complete: Go through each box and fill out as much as you can. It is completely fine not to know the answer to specific areas in the first go.
Identify knowledge gaps and priorities: Once the worksheet is completed to the best of your knowledge, jot down the knowledge gaps and priorities under each section. These could be issues, opportunities, or just lack of information about a particular area.
","The ‘Problem’ section is to be used to highlight the core problems that users face, and that the startup is attempting to solve (through its product or service). These are not problems that the startup is facing as an organisation.
Use ‘Customer Segments’ to identify the specific profile of users by whom the problem is most acutely felt. Profiles can be very specific, and may be quantised in terms of segments/market size (if data is available).
‘Solution’ is how the startup plans to address the problem. It could be a product, service, system or a combination of them.
‘Unfair Advantage’ is the distinct, hard to copy, competitive advantage the startup enjoys.
‘Unique Value Proposition’ is the core compelling message for the user that communicates the value the startup is creating for them.
‘Channels’ are the ways in which the user will interact with the solution - the way users will become aware of the solution, experience it for the first time, purchase, and continue to use.
‘Key Metrics’ are measures of the business's success in reaching and serving the user. This includes things like impressions, queries, sign ups, transactions, value of transactions, renewals, etc.
‘Cost Structure’ is the way costs are distributed between fixed and variable costs, and capital investments.
‘Revenue Streams’ are the ways in which revenue is generated - examples could be one time payments, subscription charges, loyalty fees, tiered pricing, etc.
","At the start: Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the direction. Refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck.
During the exercise: Start with participants’ existing knowledge of their business to create a first version of the model. Encourage participants to highlight any component they don't know the answer to, for discussion later.
At the close: Have participants walk you through their completed canvases, and probe them on the core strengths and weaknesses they would like to build upon.
","Which part of the business do you have the best view on? What are you least informed on?
Is there anything in here you would like to understand better? Eg. customer segment, value proposition, etc.
Do you expect your fundamental model and this canvas to change in the next 6 months?
Can you think of any other things you would like to add to this canvas? Are there any links between boxes called out?
What are your company's goals in the next 3-6-12 months? Are you considering them as you map your priorities?
How do you know something is a priority? Is there agreement within your team that these are the top priorities? Is there some assumption involved?
Do your priorities depend on each other? Are there 1-2 core priorities at the root of all the different challenges you might be facing?

2,"STRATEGY, INNOVATION & IMPACT",VISION BUILDING,Ten Types of Innovation,"The Ten Types of Innovation framework is a tool developed by consulting firm, Doblin. It maps the fundamental types of innovations that are relevant to organisations, and helps them look at innovation as a holistic activity that involves internal as well as customer facing investments. Under each type of innovation, Doblin has suggested a few strategies and tactics to use as a starting point.","While the Ten Types of Innovation tool is fairly comprehensive, it may be possible that an organisation is looking to offer innovations that are a combination of the different types — causing some initial confusion. Also, the tactics listed may not cover some new trends that teams may need to scan and map.",90-120 Min,"Map the types of innovation that are currently being offered by an organisation.
Identify strengths and weaknesses with regard to innovation at an organisation.
Identify new types of innovation that an organisation can consider.
","Familiarise yourself: Read through the various boxes of the Ten Types of Innovation. Note down what you think is the biggest differentiator in terms of innovation for your business.
Identify key innovations: At the level of Configuration, Offering, and Experience - begin by noting down what makes the business innovative currently. If you have thoughts on what could potentially be future innovations, note them down as well.
Review the tactics: Read through the tactics under each type of innovation, using the ‘Tactics Cheat Sheet’.
Unpack the innovation: Next, for each type of innovation, note down what makes your business innovative currently. Follow that by noting down potential innovations to explore in the future.
Review and brainstorm: Review the mapping of current and potential innovations. Make any necessary changes, and then brainstorm how potential innovations could be created.
","There are three major categories of innovation under which the Ten Types fit.
‘Configuration’: Innovation that focuses on how an organisation is structured. The types of innovation that fall under this category include - 1) Profit Model: How money is made — how revenue, costs and profits are organised, 2) Network: Who an organisation innovates with — how do suppliers, partners, and external innovators help, 3) Structure: How an organisation aligns its talent and assets to create more value — how are departments, units, business lines etc. organised, 4) Process: How do superior internal processes and methods help innovation — how are quality management, production, supply, procurement, hiring etc. delivered.
‘Offering’: Innovation that focuses on the performance and quality of products and services that are offered to customers. The types that are in this category are - 1) Product Performance: How products and services deliver superior value to buyers — unique product features and functionality, style, speed, safety, ease, fun, etc., 2) Product System: How complementary products and services together create more value — accessories, platforms, value added services, partner discounts, etc.
‘Experience’: Innovation that focuses on how products or services are experienced by users. The types under this category are - 1) Service: How support is provided for users to find, buy, pay, enjoy and dispose — trials, personalisation, delivery and returns, financing, self-service, warranties, repairs etc. 2) Channel: How products and services reach users — pop-up stores, e-commerce, partner stores, events, experience stores etc., 3) Brand: How offerings and organisations are communicated in a memorable, and likeable way — co-branding, own-label, certification, campaigns, packaging etc. 4) Customer Engagement: How user interactions with product or service are delivered — personalised, listening to customers, co-creation, community etc.
","At the start: Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the direction. Refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck.
During the exercise: Start with a discussion focused on what kinds of innovation are possible. Take teams through the Ten Types tool, and ask them to fill the worksheet — mapping currently adopted innovations, gaps and opportunities.
At the close: Have participants walk you through the worksheet they have filled out, and probe them on the mapping of both their current and potential innovations.
","What do you associate with the word ‘innovation’? How does your organisation look at innovation?
Is your organisation currently innovating in terms of internal processes, product, service performance, experience — or a combination of these? What is your most important innovation?
What is the biggest gap in terms of innovation for your organisation? How do you compare to your closest competitors?
In terms of configuration — have you looked at internal processes and structures before or have you focused only on external facing innovations?
In terms of Offering and Experience - what do you know about what your customers need? Are your innovations tuned to customer needs?
Have you gone through the tactics? Can you identify those you have been practicing? Is there anything missing that you want to make a note of?
Which tactics have you considered earlier and chosen not to go forward with? Which tactics are new to you? What do you potentially want to try out?
Does your organisation need incremental or transformational innovation?

3,"STRATEGY, INNOVATION & IMPACT",VISION BUILDING,Product Roadmap,"Roadmapping is an important step of clarifying the direction of a startup or programme over the next few weeks, and months. It helps teams align on their priorities and challenges moving forward.",Teams may be reluctant to get into details of their internal plans in front of a larger workshop audience.,60-90 Min,"Build consensus on a company's or programme's strategic direction.
Identify key milestones, and responsibilities for each team.
Formulate an actionable plan for teams to work towards.
","Map goals for phases: Review the various phases of development (POC, MVP, Alpha, Beta, Launch). Start by discussing what goals, the team should set for itself. Go phase by phase, map goals through consensus.
Map teams and effort: In the left-most column, identify the different teams, functional/discipline wise (like marketing, technology, design), and cross-functional/multidisciplinary (like a payments team may have individuals from technology, design, and partnership teams working together). For each team, write down expected activities under each. Estimate the kind of skills and the number of people required. This has to be a loose estimate at the beginning, becoming more concrete as the product or service offering evolves.
Map resources: Some teams may want to additionally map a resourcing roadmap - financial, material, and technical resources that may be needed to achieve each phase.
Map timelines: Add the different phases against expected timelines (in terms of weeks and months).
Digitise and share: After completion, share your roadmap within your team, and with other stakeholders.
Note: Use different colour sticky notes for goals, activities, resources, and timelines.
","The tool helps a team approach product, service or system development through a series of iterative activities and phases.
The ‘Team’ column aims to identify teams involved in different phase and their key roles and responsibilities. Teams could be research, design, technology, marketing, sales, strategy or any other group involved in product or service development.
Under each phase (POC, MVP, Beta, Launch), a team should first map goals and then the activities of the different teams towards achieving these goals. Next, map the resources required (material, financial, technical), and finally the timelines (weeks and months). Each type of data (goals, activities, investments, and time) should be written down on sticky notes of different colours.
‘POC’ or Proof Of Concept is the first tangible version of the concept. A POC validates basic assumptions with regard to functionality (of the solution) and desirability (addresses basic user needs), without necessarily having resolved all technical issues.
‘MVP’ short for Minimum Viable Product, refers to the earliest experienceable version of a service or product (with only key/necessary features). An MVP is used to better understand the core of the business opportunity, and check if customers respond favourably.
‘Alpha’ is the first product or service release with a set of actual users in a controlled, experimental environment. This allows for feedback from a sizeable set of real users, without having resolved all bugs and technical challenges.
‘Beta’ is the first public release used to gather feedback from a wide array of users. Beta tests often serve as a 'soft launch' for a product or service, testing an organisation's ability to respond to feedback. It is the stage to reach 'early adopters' who have the potential to become users.
‘Launch’ milestones cover any final priorities before going to market at scale; like additional features to be integrated, service elements refined, adjustments in communication, distribution channel logistics, etc.
‘Success Metrics’ for each phase should be derived from goals set, and help measure whether the goals have been achieved. Metrics should be both internal facing, and external market focused.
","At the start: Make sure the participants understand the goal of the activity and the direction. Refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck.
During the exercise: Help participants understand where they stand on the roadmap and if any edits should be made to the template.
At the close: Make sure clear milestones have been formulated, and encourage participants to get input from representatives of the teams listed in the roadmap that may not have been available for the activity.
","Are you familiar with this format? Do you use a version of this in your organisation?
What kind of visibility do you have into what the next 3-6-12 months look like? What are some key goals for each phase?
How far are you currently on this roadmap? Should anything here be changed to reflect your own approach?
What are the different kinds of teams you have in your organisation? What are the different project teams? Let's list the major ones in the left column.

5,"STRATEGY, INNOVATION & IMPACT",VISION BUILDING,Theory of Change,"Theory of Change (TOC) is a framework to map 'desired change' against input activities and investments. It helps innovators build relevant strategies for change by differentiating between results and impact. The framework also helps link long term and short-term goals, creating a logical flow that can be used to guide efforts. The TOC is especially relevant to social businesses, and development sector organisations, because impact is critical. However, business sector organisations may also use it to consider their own ability to create impact. 'Product Roadmap' and 'Activity Plan' can be used to inform the TOC exercise and vice versa.
","While the TOC helps identify potential strategy, there is little guarantee that activities and resources identified at an early stage will lead to estimated impact on ground. TOCs are often revisited and refined as data from the ground starts emerging.
",90-120 Min,"Create an end to end summary of the intended impact strategy of a programme or business at conceptualisation.
Diagnose and reflect on actual impact and fine tune strategy.
Identify human and resource investments needed to create impact.
","Define a vision: Discuss the intended impact of the program or service with your team.
Unpack the necessary resources: First fill in the left side of the tool to list the basic financial, people and material resources needed (or available) to roll out the programme. List down activities that these resources would help carry out. A team may choose to start with activities first, and then list resources (in case it is a proposal to raise resources).
Link efforts to impact: Link resources and activities to outputs (short-term) and outcomes (long-term) that together represent long-term impact.
List assumptions: Review the template and call out assumptions you may be making at each step. Discuss what these assumptions are, and what could be done to counter them.
","The ‘Resources & Inputs’ section is meant to park the human, knowledge, skill, financial, technological, infrastructural, systemic capabilities that are required to create impact.
‘Activities’ are those tasks that the resources will help undertake. The nature of these tasks could be both user facing (awareness building, on-boarding, servicing, etc.) and internal (process development, skill building, hiring, technology adoption, etc.). Investors need to be convinced that resources are being spent on priority activities.
‘Outputs’ are the most basic numbers and metrics that help measure results achieved because of investments made. The outputs help understand the extent of effort (for example, number of people reached, campaigns undertaken, number of learning sessions held, etc.), without going into whether the efforts were successful or not.
‘Outcomes’ are deeper metrics than outputs, and start focusing on both the quantity and quality of results. The stress is importantly on short-medium term impact metrics (for example, level of awareness in people because of campaign, skills built in people because of x number of learning sessions, etc.).
‘Impact’ focuses on longer term shifts — on real, lasting impact created by interventions. The translation of outcomes and outputs into change is really brought to the fore here (for example, does awareness lead to better decision making and choice? do skills lead to an enhanced ability to be financially empowered?).
‘Assumptions’ are risk factors that an innovator needs to keep in mind as the TOC is being built. Assumptions are important to study and adjust as implementation is done.","At the start: Make sure participants understand the goal of the activity and the direction. Refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck.
During the exercise: Start with participants’ existing knowledge of their strategic and operational plans, create a first version of the map. Discuss how they currently measure impact of their own investments.

List the effects: Start by listing visible effects of the problem, and then identify indirect impacts of the problem.
List the causes: List potential causes for the given problem or opportunity.
Dig deeper: To really get into the depth (or root cause), ask the '5 Whys'. Ask first why something is a cause, and keep asking why (derived from the preceding answer) till you have a strong, relevant root cause.
","The ‘Problem/Opportunity’ should be something specific that needs to be investigated. This could be a problem faced by the user, or an opportunity area defined by a team or organisation.
‘Effects’ are the visible and invisible impacts of the problem. They are mapped on the branches of the tree. For example, if the problem is defined as ‘Poor Public Transport’, then an effect would be - commuters getting late to work, stress in the city, chaos in certain times of the day.
‘Causes’ are underlying reasons behind the problem or opportunity. They are mapped on the roots of the tree. For example, the root cause of ‘Poor Public Transport’ could probably be, inadequate public funding’ or poor route planning.
The levels to which ‘Effects’ and ‘Causes’ can be unpacked depend on, the understanding the team has of the topic at hand.

Follow up questions: Ask follow up questions to get more detail about a particular time period, such as - What did it feel like? Why was it important? How did one come to experience it? Where was one then?  Who were some of the early adopters?, etc.
Discuss the trends: Go over the timeline, and fine-tune the sequence of information. Question what it means in terms of trends and insights.
","‘Periods’ are the distinct phases of time that the researcher is trying to map. This could be in terms of decades/months/weeks (for example, 1990s, 2000s, 2010s) or even life stages (for example, childhood/teenage/youth). The choice of time frames is flexible and to be decided by the researcher.
‘What?’ is the section in which inputs on objects/events/actions/behaviours/beliefs that fit into a particular period are noted down (for example, music in the 90s was about the Sony Walkman, in the 2000s, it was about the iPod, in 2010s, all music was on smartphones).
‘Where?’ is the section in which the input from the participant is focused on description of location — physical spaces, geographies, sectors, internet. For example, music in the 90s was about the local music store and cafes, in the 2000s, about iTunes and pirated MP3s, and in the 2010s, about streaming platforms like Spotify.
‘Who?’ focuses on the individuals, groups, communities, cultures, entities that are most closely associated with the subject in a particular period.

Any information should be written down on a sticky note and mapped on a surface (like a wall). Each note should be complete, not too short or too wordy. One data point per sticky note.
‘Themes’ start emerging as grouping of similar or complementary information starts taking place. There is no one set rule for identifying a theme; it is a matter of making sure each theme is complete in itself, and that it makes basic conceptual, logical, and emotional sense.
If there are close connections or interdependencies between themes, describing that relationship is important.
Learnings and insights are derived from the information collected under each theme. A team needs to discuss what the information collected means for them.
","At the start: Have everyone spend time reviewing their research notes, and ask them to make a note of valuable information on sticky notes. One piece of information per sticky note.
During the exercise: Help teams form clusters, feel free to make suggestions regarding the creation of sub clusters. Help them define the emerging themes.
At the close: Have participants present and discuss their mapping and learning.
","Have the teams made a note of their key data points on sticky notes? Have you provided sources for at least the key ones?

What clusters are starting to emerge? Can the team walk me through them?
Should any cluster be broken down further?
Has anything come up that felt new, surprising, refreshing? Consider using different coloured sticky notes to make a note of it.
Are there things that can sit under two or more themes? Are they represented in both clusters?

‘It Reflects the Insights and Learnings’ is the criteria that focuses on how rooted an idea is in the insights and learnings that have emerged from research.
‘Users will Find it Desirable’ is the criteria that focuses on whether the idea is something that will be welcomed by users.
‘The Team is Excited about it’ is the criteria that focuses on whether the idea is something the team is passionate about building.
‘Other criteria’ are those criteria that the team can specify themselves; costs involved, skills available, technology available, etc.. These could be some criteria to look into.
Scores under each of the criteria could be given individually (and then averaged or summed) or by the team as a whole. Allocation of weights to the criteria (for example to 50% to desirability, 20% to excitement, 30% to solves the problem) is a decision left to the team.
","At the start: Make sure participants have reviewed the tool. Help them choose a bunch of ideas from other brainstorming activities to bring into the prioritisation exercise.
During the exercise: Help teams score the ideas as they move across criteria.
At the close: Discuss the top ideas identified by each team.
","Can we go through all the previous brainstorming we have done, and choose the best ideas to bring into this prioritisation exercise? What are the top 10-12 ideas that we want to prioritise amongst?
Do the pre-defined criteria in the first column work for you? Do you want to add more?
Do you want to assign any weights to the criteria?
Which for your team, is the most important criteria? Do the weights reflect this?
How do you want to score the ideas? Are you using points or some sort of a scale (low-medium-high)?

Do we agree with the prioritisation? Have the best ideas made it to the top?
If you are not happy with your prioritisation, do you want to perhaps relook at the weights you may have assigned to the criteria?

","Storyboards are visualisations in comic book style that aim to communicate important aspects of a product or service experience.
Storyboards try and cover not just people interactions but also document objects, environments, and messaging (think POEMS) that make up a complete service experience.
A storyboard is a combination of illustrations, descriptive text, and dialogue (to represent interaction between users and service providers).
A storyboard may focus on the entire end-to-end journey, or just a specific user task / part of the service, for example, opening a new bank account, submitting KYC documents, depositing loan payments, etc.
While there is no set number of scenes that can be part of a storyboard. However, 3-10 frames are a safe target to aim for - 3 for simple stories focused on a key service aspect, and 10 if one is trying to capture the essence of a complete end-to-end experience.

","Outline the key steps: Start by discussing the key stages, user actions and interactions along the experience journey. Refer to the Journey Map and Service Blueprint tools if they have been already developed.
Visualise the touch-points: For each step in the service journey, identify the screens necessary to bring the concept to life, and draw them out. Design different versions of the wireframes if the intent is to do A/B testing.
Connect the screens: Connect the different screens by linking how a button may lead from one screen to another.
Test & Refine: Test wireframes with different users, and record points of improvement.
","Wireframes are basic visualisations, basic boxes and text that are used to represent digital screens.
It is rare for designers to build wireframes for each and every step of a service journey, the focus is usually on key screens and interactions. Alternatively, detailed wireframes are often built for one part of the journey. For example, on-boarding screens, learning section, profile pages, etc.
Typically, phone outlines are used to communicate that the screens are meant for an app. Similarly for web screens, a laptop outline can be used.
Screens are connected by drawing lines between them. Lines represent how buttons and links connect screens to each other.
Wireframes are tested with users in the form of paper prints or as interactive prototypes (where buttons actually work). An interactive digital prototype can be created by using basic software like PowerPoint or professional design software like Zeplin or Invision.
Testing of wireframes can be done through two approaches; aided (where designers explain each screen to users) and unaided (no explanations given to user). Teams should use a mix of both.
","At the start: Make sure the team has a clear understanding of the key steps of their service.
During the exercise: Help teams prioritise screens to prototype. Help them create clear wireframes, while not wasting time on adding unnecessary detail. Ensure teams think about screen flows and connections.

Identify tester profile: Note down the kind of testers and users the testing will be focused on. Profiles, segments, groups, etc. can be mentioned here along with the sample size.
Conduct the test: Use the tool as guidance as you go about the test.
Test learnings and review: Once the tests are done, note down the results and learnings in this section. If a version meets the purpose, move ahead. Otherwise, discuss iteration of versions and further testing needs.
","The ‘Purpose of Test’ section is meant to note down the key reason for which the test is being conducted. This could be drawn from one of the use cases.
The ‘Key Metrics of Success/Failure’ box is meant to note down the key metrics based on which test results will be evaluated. For example, time spent, signup, purchase, feedback score, etc.
‘Testing Formats’ is the section in which the format of the experiment has to be described. For example, visual concept test, interactive screen test, test with app users, etc. The test may involve studying actual use of a product or service, or may involve recording feedback for concepts (similar level to scenarios and card sort).
‘Testing Scope’ is the section in which the designer has to define how versions are different from each other, along with rationale on why the differences are relevant. This would include specifying constants and variables in each version.
‘Tester Profile’ is the section in which the designer needs to identify who the different versions are to be tested with. Usually, in A/B testing there is a ‘Control’ group that a base version is tested with, and ‘Treatment’ groups with which different versions are tested.
‘Test Learnings’ is the section in which one has to note down the results of testing, in terms of metrics achieved and feedback received from testers.
Note: Tests are considered valid if different groups of a single user type test all versions (for example, within existing customers — groups 1,2,n test versions A,B,n). Tests are also valid if different versions are tested with one group of one customer type (for example, group 1 of customers test version A,B,n). Tests are invalid if different versions are tested with different types of users (for example, A with existing customers, B with new customers, C with not customers), as relevant comparisons cannot be made.

The framework was first proposed by Nobel prize winning economist, Richard Thaler.",The NUDGE Framework is best used to influence moments where people are making a clear choice/decision.

","The ‘Choice/Decision Moment’ section is meant to note down the decision that is being designed for. What is happening currently?, can be noted in the ‘Current Choice/Decision’ box, and the intended action in the ‘Desired Choice/Decision’ box.
The ‘User/Stakeholder Persona/Profile’ box is for making a note of the key attributes; needs, attitudes, behaviours, etc. that describe the person who is making the choice.
‘Investigate Incentives’ is the section where designers can list potential incentives for users that can work as the nudge. Incentives can be monetary, social recognition, personal growth, etc. Designers are to decide how these incentives are offered and communicated.
‘Understand Choices’ is a nudge approach where designers are able to communicate the costs vs. benefits of the different choices to the user, and therefore influence choice. For this to happen, the costs and benefits of different decisions need to be mapped first, and then prioritised based on what is most important for users.
‘Consider Defaults’ is a nudge approach where designers set defaults on the product or service that are closest to a desired choice. An evaluation of moments where defaults are required, and how they will be set needs to be done.
‘Give Feedback’ is a nudge approach where designers decide on points in the decision making process where proactive feedback can help the user make the correct choice. An evaluation of the kind of feedback, and how it will be communicated needs to be done by designers.
‘Expect Errors’ is a nudge approach where designers accommodate the most common errors made by users at the time of decision into the design of the product or service, not to minimise error but to absorb and move forward with common errors. An evaluation of what these common errors are, and how they can be accommodated needs to be done.

46,BEHAVIOUR DESIGN,TOOLS,SWITCH Framework,"The Switch Framework is widely used to guide behaviour change approaches, especially in the behaviour change communication domain. The model proposes that there are three elements of behaviour; the rational side (The Rider), the emotional side (The Elephant), and the environment (The Path); and that one can change behaviour if interventions take these three elements into account. The framework was proposed by Chip Heath and Dan Heath in their book - Switch: How to Change Things When Change Is Hard.","While the SWITCH model is great in terms of highlighting different aspects of how behaviour change can be approached, it is dependent on a robust understanding of behaviours and motivations in the first place.

Refine & Review: See how the different aspects are connected to each other. Discuss a comprehensive strategy that builds on the three elements. ","The framework provides three broad elements that account for logical (Rider), emotional (Elephant), and environmental (Path) aspects of behaviour change.
‘Direct The Rider’: Behaviour change can happen when we provide crystal clear direction to the ‘rational side’ (The Rider) of a person who is to adopt a behaviour. To be able to appeal to the rational side, one can follow three strategies; 1) Follow The Bright Spots - Build on existing positive behaviours and success stories, learn from people with positive behaviours, and use that to influence others and design interventions 2) Script the Critical Moves - Dissolve the resistance by breaking down the change into specific tasks, identify clear actions that can be implemented, and how they contribute to change 3) Point to the Destination - Create a specific goal that people can work towards and respond to, define an end state that is logical and worth aspiring to.
‘Motivate The Elephant’: Behaviour change can happen when we engage a person’s emotions (The Elephant). To appeal to people’s ‘emotional’ side, one can follow three strategies; 1) Find the Feeling - Make people feel positively inspired to change, identify what motivations exist and how they can be enhanced 2) Shrink The Change: Break down seemingly large complex change into simple, small steps until it no longer seems daunting 3) Grow Your People: Identify skills, knowledge, resources, tools, rewards etc. that can help equip people for change.
‘Shape The Path’: Behaviour change can happen when one changes the context (The Path) in which action is happening. To be able to create an enabling ‘environment’, one can follow three strategies; 1) Tweak the Environment: Tweak elements in the physical environment that are bottlenecks, and/or introduce new elements that can enable desired behaviour 2) Build Habits: Translate behaviour change into habits by identifying ways to make desired behaviour repeatable and consistent, provide for cycles of learning 3) Rally the Herd: Get change recognised and supported by other people, identify ways to inform and involve groups in the change process.

The model focuses on identifying ways to make the user experience simpler, more engaging, and more rewarding so that users keep returning to a product or service. For a business, habit based products or services are more efficient, offer business predictability, and generate greater customer lifetime value. The model was put forward by Nir Eyal in his book, Hooked.",The Hook Model was developed based on learnings of user behaviour on online platforms and social networking sites. It may therefore come across as a limited framework in some contexts.,90-120 Min,"Identify a strategy to encourage users to come back to a product or service after they have used it for the first time.

","Familiarise yourself: Read through the various boxes of the Hook Model and consider how these may apply to a current or proposed product or service.
Map for first time/new users: Begin by considering how a first time or new user is being taken through the steps. Start by mapping the current journey, and then identify gaps.
Map for existing users: Next, consider an existing user who can potentially stay with the product or service for a long time. Map the current journey, and then identify gaps.
Brainstorm and discuss: Based on the gaps identified for new and current users, identify potential solutions to experiment with.
","There are four major components of the HOOK Model - Triggers, Action, Rewards and Investment.
‘Triggers’: Things that prompt users to interact with a product/service. There are two types - 1) Internal Triggers associated with basic emotions (such as boredom, loneliness, excitement), and routines (such as reading, budgeting, seeking a deal) that users are trying to address. If a product or service is closely associated with an emotion or routine, that association functions as the trigger 2) External Triggers: Triggers focused on marketing and communication that influence customers. There are four types of external triggers - A) Paid Triggers: Advertising, search engine marketing, and other paid channels B) Earned Triggers: Things like press mentions, awards, viral online stories, etc. that are not paid for C) Relationship Triggers: Recommendations from customers, communities, and partners D) Owned Triggers: Triggers that use the company's own channels once a user has signed up or made a purchase (like app icons, notifications, newsletters, etc.).
‘Action’: Things that minimise users’ efforts and increase ease of use of a product or service, bring users back. There are six elements to minimising effort - 1) Time: Reduce the time it takes to start using a product or service 2) Money: Reduce the monetary cost for users 3) Physical effort: Reduce the amount of labour involved in use 4) Brain cycles: Reduce the level of mental effort and focus required to use 5) Social deviance: Reduce the resistance the use faces from the user’s personal network 6) Non-routine: Reduce the level to which the use disrupts existing routines.
‘Variable Rewards’: Things that incentivise and engage users to use a product or service. Variable rewards are incentives that vary (are unpredictable) because variance tends to keep users engaged. There are three fundamental types of rewards - 1) Reward of the Tribe: Rewards that focus on social participation, and recognition 2) Reward of the Hunt: Rewards that focus on material, and informational benefit 3) Reward of the Self: Rewards that focus on self development, and personal growth.
‘Investment’: Things that get users to invest time, resources and effort, and therefore associate value in a product and service. There are five main ways in which users can become invested - 1) Content: Users stay if they create and store content that they value 2) Data: Users stay if they share and link information (like KYC) that they would rather not share again if not essential 3) Network: Users stay if they become a part of a valued community; as a follower, a friend, as someone with followers. 4) Reputation: Users stay when they have a positive reputation within a community 5) Skill: Users stay if they develop skill or knowledge that they value.

Gamification does not guarantee better customer engagement, especially if the core value proposition and experience are weak.",60-90 Min,"Create a new service or product experience with gamified elements as a way to differentiate experience.
Introduce gamification as a part of the current product or service experience as a way to improve engagement.
Note: The Gamification Board is a starting point for actual gamified elements to be designed, and tested as prototypes - It is in a sense a planning and scoping tool.
","Familiarise yourself: Read through the template and discuss the broad goal of gamification.
Identify game dynamics: Choose the game dynamics that you want to create. List out why these dynamics are important to create and how they will be created.
Map missions, levels and tasks: Break down the game dynamics into missions, levels and tasks that users will have to complete as a way of participating in the gamified experience.
Identify points, badges and leaderboards: List out when, why and how many points and badges will be awarded to users for participating in missions, levels, and tasks. Outline how leaderboards and dashboards will be used to inform users.
Review and discuss: Discuss the gamified concept that can be derived from the board.
","‘Broad Goal’ is the core strategic reason gamification is being chosen as a strategy; Increasing engagement, forming habits, differentiating experience, etc. could be some goals to consider.
‘Game Dynamics’ are the strategies that designers use to realise gamification. Among these are - 1) Competition: Creating a sense of competition at individual and team level 2) Collaboration: Creating a sense of community and collaboration among users 3) Progress & Achievement: Offering journeys that signify growth and evolution for individuals and teams 4) Exploration and Surprise: Creating unpredictability and sense of adventure through gamification.
‘Game Mechanics’ are specific tactics that help designers realise game dynamics. Among these are - 1) ‘Missions’: Create a sense of progress, and help navigate users towards a desired end state. For example, financial planning could be broken down into short term, mid term and long term missions 2) ‘Levels’: Stages into which Missions are broken down. For example, financial planning may have levels such as basic, adequate, excellent 3) ‘Tasks’: Activities within levels that need to be completed to move from one Level to another, and to complete Missions. For example, planning in the short term may mean investing $200 in deposits, insurance, equity funds etc 4) ‘Points’: Scores assigned for completion of tasks, levels, and missions. For example, 100 points for every $10 invested. 5) ‘Badges’: Indicators of accomplishment that go beyond points. For example, someone who invests regularly could get a badge of ‘responsible investor’ 6) ‘Leaderboards’: Dashboards that show where individuals and teams stand vis-a-vis each other in terms of points, badges, progress level, etc.
","At the start: Make sure participants understand the goal of the activity and the direction. Refer to facilitation questions if they are feeling stuck.
During the exercise: Start with a discussion on gamification and the teams’ awareness of the concept. Take the participants through the broad framework, and engage them in discussion on how gamification may or may not be relevant to them.
At the close: Have participants walk through the worksheet, and probe them on how they could translate their broad strategy into prototypes and experiments.
","What do you understand by gamification? Are there aspects of your current solution that you would say are gamified? Have you seen or experienced any gamification? What can you learn from there?
Are you planning to gamify what you do currently? Or are you using this as an opportunity to completely rethink the way the solution is structured?
What are the biggest risks in the adoption of gamification? Will it distract you and the user?
What is the broad goal for gamification of your solution? How does the broad goal translate into choice of game dynamics?
Which game mechanics do you intend on using?
What are the most important missions you want users to complete? Will these missions be engaging and meaningful for users?
How are you breaking down missions into specific levels and tasks? Why are the tasks important for you?
How are you awarding points and badges to users? Are they exciting and valuable?
What kind of leaderboards are you considering?
How will you communicate with users? How will you let them know that your solution is gamified?

51,NETWORK BUILDING,NETWORKING,Mentor Check-in,"Mentor Check-Ins enable program participants to receive input from industry professionals who have faced similar challenges or have specific skills and insight. Mentors can help guide participants on diverse aspects such as business strategy, product-market fit, marketing, scaling, etc.","Participants draw value from mentorship when mentors have relevant experiences and knowledge to share. The quality of mentor recruitment, and the access teams have to mentors are critical factors to consider.",60 Min,"Connect innovators to experts that can help define challenges and opportunities.
Connect innovators to experts that can help create and implement solutions.
","Do your research: Before choosing a mentor to reach out to, consider which ones are most likely to have relevant inputs. Check availability and commitment as you establish contact.
Meet with mentor: Make sure the mentor has all the information they need about you before the meeting. On your end, prepare a few key questions you'd like to discuss, and try and send these over to the mentor before the meeting.
Keep in touch: If a valuable relationship starts, make sure to keep them in the loop about your progress.
","The template provided is only meant to be a representative agenda for a mentor-participant discussion. Reasonable time must be allocated to each part of the conversation.
It is important that at least in the first conversation, participants introduce themselves and their role in the organisation they are representing. A script for this can be noted in the ‘Introduce yourself’ section.
The ‘Present your product or service’ is the core of mentor-participant conversation. This could be done using a pitch deck or a business plan document, at least for the first time.
‘Collect feedback’ is the part of the conversation in which participants can share points they'd like feedback on. Based on the theme of the conversation, mentors are likely to have their own questions and inputs at this stage.
","Prior to the session: Help make the mentor-participant connect. If happening offline at a workshop, this should be easier. However, if the mentors and participants are coordinating online, ensure that each participant has found at least one relevant mentor to speak to.
During the check-in: If this is part of a workshop, and participants and mentors are networking, ensure that participants get to speak to relevant mentors, and get enough time with mentors.
At the close: Have mentors and participants share their feedback on the experience.
","Are we all prepared with documents (pitch decks or plans) that we want to receive mentor feedback on?
Have you identified mentors that you think are critical for you to speak to?
What do you want to focus on in your conversations with mentors?
Do you want to receive dedicated feedback from one mentor or quick feedback from multiple mentors?
Can we all please stick to the time-slots? Does anyone have an issue with the slots?
How did the feedback differ across mentors? What was the best piece of advice you received today?
Will you be speaking to the mentors again sometime?
Do you have any feedback for the mentors?

52,NETWORK BUILDING,NETWORKING,Speed Dating,"The Speed Dating format is used to facilitate rapid and diverse conversations; participant-participant introductions, participant-mentor discussions, elevator pitch practice, etc. in a fun way.","Speed Dating formats typically leave little room for long, detailed discussions, the facilitator should allocate a reasonable amount of time for conversations based on the goal of the session.",30 Min,"Create multiple conversations in a short period of time.
Introduce diverse sets of people to each other.
Provide multi-dimensional feedback.
Practice presentation and storytelling skills.
","Define talking points: Prior to the Speed Dating session, define a few talking points to use in the short span of time you will be given.
Try them out: As the Speed Dating is going on, tweak your discussion points according to the person you may be meeting.
","In Speed Dating formats, two groups of people (like participants and mentors) are arranged such that while individuals from one group remains stationed at one spot (say mentors), the other set of individuals (participants) are mobile, and spend a predetermined amount of time at each station (for a participant-mentor discussion). As time for conversation lapses, individuals from the mobile group move to the next station to have another conversation. This continues till an intended number of conversations have taken place.
‘Talking Points’ are essentially the key aspects that the conversation should be focused on, this depends on the nature of the session. For participant-mentor discussions, participants are encouraged to practice their elevator pitches for example, and have questions ready based on the backgrounds of the mentors.
","Prior to the session: Make sure everyone is aware of the time they will be given and what will be discussed. Also, set up the room so that the mobile group can easily circulate between the stations.
During the exercise: Keep track of time, and use a bell or music to communicate when it is time for people to move to the next station. Ensure everyone adheres to the time limit.
At the close: Have participants share their key takeaways.
","Is everyone clear on what they will be discussed and how much time we will have?
Do we know who is stationary and who is mobile?
Should we do a practice run before we start?
Can we please keep moving when we are done?
What did we all learn from the exercise? Do you have any feedback to share?
